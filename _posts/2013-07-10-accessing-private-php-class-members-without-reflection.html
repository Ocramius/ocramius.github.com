        <p>
            A couple of weeks ago I was working on a
            <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager/issues/62" target="_blank">very tricky issue</a> on
            <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager" target="_blank">ProxyManager</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The problem is simple: instantiating
            <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/class.reflectionclass.php" target="_blank">ReflectionClass</a> or
            <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/class.reflectionproperty.php" target="_blank">ReflectionProperty</a> is
            slow, and by slow, I mean <strong>really slow!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The reason for this reasearch is that I'm trying to optimize a
            "<a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.2/en/modules/zend.stdlib.hydrator.html" target="_blank">hydrator</a>"
            to work with larger data-sets by still keeping a low initialization overhead.
        </p>

        <h2>PHP 5.4 to the rescue!</h2>

        <p>
            PHP 5.4 comes with a new API for Closures, which is
            <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/closure.bind.php" target="_blank"><code>Closure#bind()</code></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <code>Closure#bind()</code> basically allows you to get an instance of a closure with the scope of a given
            object or class. Neat! That's basically like adding APIs to existing objects!
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's break some OOP encapsulation to fit our needs.
        </p>

        <p>
            The techniques to access private members are already explained on the PHP manual, but I am going to make a
            simplified example anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's what you have to do to steal <code>Kitchen#yummy</code> from following object:
        </p>

{% highlight php %}<?php

class Kitchen
{
    private $yummy = 'cake';
}{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            First of all, let's define a closure to read the property as if we had access to it:
        </p>


{% highlight php %}<?php

$sweetsThief = function (Kitchen $kitchen) {
    return $kitchen->yummy;
}{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            Let's use it to steal some <code>yummy</code> stuff from the <code>Kitchen</code>:
        </p>

{% highlight php %}<?php

$kitchen = new Kitchen();

var_dump($sweetsThief($kitchen));{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            Sadly, this <a href="http://3v4l.org/ET06l" target="_blank">will result</a> in <code>$sweetsThief</code>
            being caught with a fatal error that looks like following:
        </p>

{% highlight php %}Fatal error: Cannot access private property Kitchen::$yummy in [...] on line [...]{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            Let's use <code>Closure#bind()</code> to make our thief smarter:
        </p>

{% highlight php %}<?php

$kitchen = new Kitchen();

// Closure::bind() actually creates a new instance of the closure
$sweetsThief = Closure::bind($sweetsThief, null, $kitchen);

var_dump($sweetsThief($kitchen));{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            <a href="http://3v4l.org/2E2mr" target="_blank">Success</a>! We can now get to the <code>cake</code>!
        </p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>Changing closure scope vs. Reflection: performance</h2>

        <p>
            How does this technique compare with <code>ReflectionProperty#getValue()</code>? Is it actually faster?
        </p>

        <p>
            I've built a simple benchmark to profile the "setup" step for this trick over a million iterations:
        </p>

        {% highlight php %}<?php

for ($i = 0; $i < 1000000; $i += 1) {
    $sweetsThief = Closure::bind(function (Kitchen $kitchen) {
        return $kitchen->yummy;
    }, null, 'Kitchen');
}{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight php %}<?php

for ($i = 0; $i < 1000000; $i += 1) {
    $sweetsThief = new ReflectionProperty('Kitchen', 'yummy');
    $sweetsThief->setAccessible(true);
}{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            Turns out that on my pc (PHP 5.4.9 ubuntu 13.04 box), the first script takes <code>~ 1.3</code> seconds
            to run, while the second one requires <code>~ 2.6</code> seconds. Reflection is slower here.
        </p>

        <p>
            That's completely un-interesting, since nobody will ever instantiate a million reflection properties,
            or at least I cannot find a good reason to do that.
        </p>

        <p>
            What seems to be more interesting is how <strong>accessing properties</strong> compares. I've profiled
            that too:
        </p>


        {% highlight php %}<?php

$kitchen = new Kitchen();

$sweetsThief = Closure::bind(function (Kitchen $kitchen) {
    return $kitchen->yummy;
}, null, 'Kitchen');

for ($i = 0; $i < 1000000; $i += 1) {
    $sweetsThief($kitchen);
}{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight php %}<?php

$kitchen = new Kitchen();

$sweetsThief = new ReflectionProperty('Kitchen', 'yummy');
$sweetsThief->setAccessible(true);

for ($i = 0; $i < 1000000; $i += 1) {
    $sweetsThief->getValue($kitchen);
}{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            I would actually have expected the reflection system being very slow in this case, but in fact it is much
            faster!
        </p>

        <p>
            The first script took <code>~ 3.4</code> seconds to run, while the second one just needed
            <code>~ 1.4</code> seconds!
        </p>

        <p>
            That basically tells us that the instantiation time of reflection classes is negligible, and that it's
            actually faster than userland code in accessing properties.
        </p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>Accessing private class properties by reference</h2>

        <p>
            There's actually one big advantage in using a Closure instead of ReflectionProperty, which is that you can
            now <a href="http://3v4l.org/W12Hf" target="_blank">retrieve a private property by reference</a>!
        </p>


{% highlight php %}<?php

$sweetsThief = Closure::bind(function & (Kitchen $kitchen) {
    return $kitchen->yummy;
}, null, $kitchen);


$cake = & $sweetsThief($kitchen);
$cake = 'lie';

var_dump('the cake is a ' . $sweetsThief($kitchen));{% endhighlight %}

        <hr/>

        <h2>A generic property reader abstraction</h2>

        <p>
            With all these new concepts we can write a very simplified accessor that allows us to read any property
            of any object:
        </p>

{% highlight php %}<?php

$reader = function & ($object, $property) {
    $value = & Closure::bind(function & () use ($property) {
        return $this->$property;
    }, $object, $object)->__invoke();

    return $value;
};

$kitchen = new Kitchen();
$cake    = & $reader($kitchen, 'cake');
$cake    = 'sorry, I ate it!';

var_dump($kitchen);{% endhighlight %}

        <p>
            Here's the <a href="http://3v4l.org/JE0eX" target="_blank">working example</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            That's it: accessing any property, anywhere, and that even by reference! Success! We have broken the rules
            once again!
        </p>

        <p>
            I won't cover the "writing properties" part, nor handling inherited private properties,
            since that's just details of this basic trick that need more code and are un-interesting to us.
        </p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            Yet another time, PHP shows its best and worst aspects all together. It's a horrible language with a
            horrible syntax, but it allows us to write amazing code and to run around a huge number of language
            limitations by just providing new and awesome features at every release!
        </p>

        <p>
            I won't use this technique myself, but it was interesting to dive into it, and it will become useful again
            if I need to get references to private/protected class members in my crazy proxy projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            I should hereby add a disclaimer: use with caution!
