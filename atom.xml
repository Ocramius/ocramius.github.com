    Please note that this article explains complexity in internal ORM operations with the <strong>Big-O</strong>
    notation. Consider reading
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/487258/plain-english-explanation-of-big-o" target="_blank">this article</a>, 
    if you are not familiar with the <strong>Big-O</strong> syntax.

<h2>What is hydration?</h2>

<p>
    Doctrine ORM, like most ORMs, is performing a process called <strong>Hydration</strong> when converting database
    results into objects.
</p>

<p>
    This process usually involves reading a record from a database result and then converting the column values
    into an object's properties.
</p>

<p>
    Here is a little pseudo-code snippet that shows what a mapper is actually doing under the hood:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$results          = [];
$reflectionFields = $mappingInformation-&gt;reflectionFields();

foreach ($resultSet-&gt;fetchRow() as $row) {
    $object = new $mappedClassName;

    foreach ($reflectionFields as $column =&gt; $reflectionField) {
        $reflectionField-&gt;setValue($object, $row[$column]);
    }

    $results[] = $object;
}

return $results;
</code></pre>

<p>
    That's a very basic example, but this gives you an idea of what an ORM is doing for you.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
    As you can see, this is an <code>O(N)</code> operation (assuming a constant number of reflection fields).
</p>

<p>
    There are multiple ways to speed up this particular process, but we can only remove constant overhead from
    it, and not actually reduce it to something more efficient.
</p>

<h2>When is hydration expensive?</h2>

<p>
    Hydration starts to become expensive with complex resultsets.
</p>

<p>
    Consider the following SQL query:
</p>

<pre><code class="sql">SELECT
    u.id       AS userId,
    u.username AS userUsername,
    s.id       AS socialAccountId,
    s.username AS socialAccountUsername,
    s.type     AS socialAccountType
FROM
    user u
LEFT JOIN
    socialAccount s
        ON s.userId = u.id
</code></pre>

<p>
    Assuming that the relation from <code>user</code> to <code>socialAccount</code> is a <code>one-to-many</code>,
    this query retrieves all the social accounts for all the users in our application
</p>

<p>
    A resultset may be as follows:
</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>userId</th>
            <th>userUsername</th>
            <th>socialAccountId</th>
            <th>socialAccountUsername</th>
            <th>socialAccountType</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>ocramius@gmail.com</td>
            <td>20</td>
            <td>ocramius</td>
            <td>Facebook</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>ocramius@gmail.com</td>
            <td>21</td>
            <td>@ocramius</td>
            <td>Twitter</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>ocramius@gmail.com</td>
            <td>22</td>
            <td>ocramiusaethril</td>
            <td>Last.fm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>grandpa@example.com</td>
            <td><code>NULL</code></td>
            <td><code>NULL</code></td>
            <td><code>NULL</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>grandma@example.com</td>
            <td>85</td>
            <td>awesomegrandma9917</td>
            <td>Facebook</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
    As you can see, we are now joining 2 tables in the results, and the ORM has to perform more complicated operations:
</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>
        Hydrate <strong>1</strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <code>User</code> object for
        <i>ocramius@gmail.com</i>
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Hydrate <strong>3</strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <code>SocialAccount</code> 
        instances into 
        <code>User#$socialAccounts</code> 
        for 
        <i>ocramius@gmail.com</i>,
        while skipping re-hydrating
        <code>User</code>
        <i>ocramius@gmail.com</i>
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Hydrate <strong>1</strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <code>User</code>
        object for
        <i>grandpa@example.com</i>
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Skip hydrating
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <code>User#$socialAccounts</code>
        for
        <i>grandpa@example.com</i>,
        as no social accounts are associated
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Hydrate <strong>1</strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <code>User</code>
        object for
        <i>grandma@example.com</i>
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Hydrate <strong>1</strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <code>SocialAccount</code>
        instance into
        <code>User#$socialAccounts</code>
        for
        <i>grandma@example.com</i>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">DOCS</span>
    This operation is what is done by Doctrine ORM when you use the
    <abbr title="Doctrine Query Language">DQL</abbr>
    <a href="http://docs.doctrine-project.org/en/latest/reference/dql-doctrine-query-language.html#joins" target="_blank">
        Fetch Joins
    </a>
    feature.
</p>

<p>
    Fetch joins are a very efficient way to hydrate multiple records without resorting to multiple queries, but there
    are two performance issues with this approach (both not being covered by this article):
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Empty records require some useless looping inside the ORM internals (see <i>grandpa@example.com</i>'s
        social account). This is a quick operation, but we can't simply ignore those records upfront.
    </li>
    <li>
        If multiple duplicated records are being joined (happens a lot in <code>many-to-many</code> associations),
        then we want to de-duplicate records by keeping a temporary in-memory identifier map.
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="alert alert-danger">
    Additionally, our operation starts to become more complicated, as it is now <code>O(n * m)</code>, with
    <code>n</code> and <code>m</code> being the records in the <code>user</code> and the <code>socialAccount</code>
    tables.
</p>

<p>
    What the ORM is actually doing here is <strong>normalizing</strong> data that was fetched in a de-normalized
    resultset, and that is going through your CPU and your memory.
</p>

<h2>Bringing hydration cost to an extreme</h2>

<p>
    The process of hydration becomes extremely expensive when more than <strong>2</strong> <code>LEFT JOIN</code>
    operations clauses are part of our queries:
</p>

<pre><code class="sql">SELECT
    u.id         AS userId,
    u.username   AS userUsername,
    sa.id        AS socialAccountId,
    sa.username  AS socialAccountUsername,
    sa.type      AS socialAccountType,
    s.id         AS sessionId,
    s.expiresOn  AS sessionExpiresOn,
FROM
    user u
LEFT JOIN
    socialAccount sa
        ON sa.userId = u.id
LEFT JOIN
    session s
        ON s.userId = u.id
</code></pre>

<p>
    This kind of query produces a much larger resultset, and the results are duplicated by a lot:
</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped" style="max-width: 500px">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>userId</th>
            <th>user Username</th>
            <th>social Account Id</th>
            <th>social Account Username</th>
            <th>social Account Type</th>
            <th>session Id</th>
            <th>session Expires On</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>

            <td>Last.fm</td>
            <td>ocramius-android</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>grandpa@example.com</td>
            <td><code>NULL</code></td>
            <td><code>NULL</code></td>
            <td><code>NULL</code></td>
            <td><code>NULL</code></td>
            <td><code>NULL</code></td>

        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>grandma@example.com</td>

            <td>home-pc</td>
            <td>2015-04-15 10:05:31</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
    If you try to re-normalize this resultset, you can actually see how many useless de-duplication operation
    have to happen.
</p>

<p>
    That is because the <code>User</code> <i>ocramius@gmail.com</i> has multiple active sessions on
    multiple devices, as well as multiple social accounts.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-danger">
    <span class="label label-warning">SLOW!</span>
    The hydration operations on this resultset are <code>O(n * m * q)</code>, which I'm going to simply
    generalize as <code>O(n ^ m)</code>, with <code>n</code> being the amount of results, and <code>m</code>
    being the amount of joined tables.
</p>

<p>
    Here is a graphical representation of <code>O(n ^ m)</code>:
</p>

<p>
    <img
        src="/img/posts/2015-04-13-doctrine-orm-optimization-hydration/boy-that-escalated-quickly.jpg"
        alt="Boy, that escalated quickly"
    />
</p>

<p>
    Yes, it is bad.
</p>

<h2>How to avoid <code>O(n ^ m)</code> hydration?</h2>

<p>
    <code>O(n ^ m)</code> can be avoided with some very simple, yet effective approaches.
</p>

<blockquote cite="me">
    No, it's not <em>"don't use an ORM"</em>, you muppet.
</blockquote>

<h3>Avoiding <code>one-to-many</code> and <code>many-to-many</code> associations</h3>

<p>
    Collection valued associations are as useful as problematic, as you never know how much data you are
    going to load.
</p>

<p>
    Unless you use <code>fetch="EXTRA_LAZY"</code> and <code>Doctrine\Common\Collections\Collection#slice()</code>
    wisely, you will probably make your app crash if you initialize a very large collection of associated objects.
</p>

<p>
    Therefore, the simplest yet most limiting advice is to avoid collection-valued associations whenever
    they are not strictly necessary.
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, reduce the amount of bi-directional associations to the strict necessary.
</p>

<p>
    After all, code that is not required should not be written in first place.
</p>

<h3>Multi-step hydration</h3>

<p>
    The second approach is simpler, and allows us to exploit how the ORM's <code>UnitOfWork</code> is working
    internally.
</p>

<p>
    In fact, we can simply split hydration for different associations into different queries, or multiple steps:
</p>

<pre><code class="sql">SELECT
    u.id         AS userId,
    u.username   AS userUsername,
    s.id         AS socialAccountId,
    s.username   AS socialAccountUsername,
    s.type       AS socialAccountType
FROM
    user u
LEFT JOIN
    socialAccount s
        ON s.userId = u.id
</code></pre>

<p>
    We already know this query: hydration for it is <code>O(n * m)</code>, but that's the best we can do,
    regardless of how we code it.
</p>

<pre><code class="sql">SELECT
    u.id        AS userId,
    u.username  AS userUsername,
    s.id        AS sessionId,
    s.expiresOn AS sessionExpiresOn,
FROM
    user u
LEFT JOIN
    session s
        ON s.userId = u.id
</code></pre>

<p>
    This query is another <code>O(n * m)</code> hydration one, but we are now only loading the user sessions
    in the resultsets, avoiding duplicate results overall.
</p>

<p>
    By re-fetching the same users, we are telling the ORM to re-hydrate those objects (which are now in memory,
    stored in the <code>UnitOfWork</code>): that fills the <code>User#$sessions</code> collections.
</p>

<p>
    Also, please note that we could have used a <code>JOIN</code> instead of a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>, but that
    would have triggered lazy-loading on the sessions for the <i>grandpa@example.com</i> <code>User</code>
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, we could also skip the <i>userUsername</i> field from the results, as it already is in memory
    and well known.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
    <span class="label label-success">SOLUTION:</span>
    We now reduced the hydration complexity from <code>O(n ^ m)</code> to <code>O(n * m * k)</code>, with
    <code>n</code> being the amount of <code>User</code> instances, <code>m</code> being the amount of associated
    <code>to-many</code> results, and <code>k</code> being the amount of associations that we want to hydrate.
</p>

<h3>Coding multi-step hydration in Doctrine ORM</h3>

<p>
    Let's get more specific and code the various queries represented above in
    <abbr title="Doctrine Query Language">DQL</abbr>.
</p>

<p>
    Here is the <code>O(n ^ m)</code> query (in this case, <code>O(n ^ 3)</code>):
</p>

<pre><code class="php">return $entityManager
    -&gt;createQuery('
        SELECT
            user, socialAccounts, sessions 
        FROM
            User user
        LEFT JOIN
            user.socialAccounts socialAccounts
        LEFT JOIN
            user.sessions sessions
    ')
    -&gt;getResult();
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is how you'd code the multi-step hydration approach:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">$users = $entityManager
    -&gt;createQuery('
        SELECT
            user, socialAccounts
        FROM
            User user
        LEFT JOIN
            user.socialAccounts socialAccounts
    ')
    -&gt;getResult();

$entityManager
    -&gt;createQuery('
        SELECT PARTIAL
            user.{id}, sessions
        FROM
            User user
        LEFT JOIN
            user.sessions sessions
    ')
    -&gt;getResult(); // result is discarded (this is just re-hydrating the collections)

return $users;
</code></pre>

<p>
    I'd also add that this is the only legitimate use-case for partial hydration that I ever
    had, but it's a personal opinion/feeling.
</p>

<h2>Other alternatives (science fiction)</h2>

<p>
    As you may have noticed, all this overhead is caused by normalizing de-normalized data coming
    from the DB.
</p>

<p>
    Other solutions that we may work on in the future include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Generating hydrator code - solves constant overhead issues, performs better with
        <abbr title="Just In Time">JIT</abbr> engines such as <abbr title="HipHop VM">HHVM</abbr>
    </li>
    <li>
        Leveraging the capabilities of powerful engines such as PostgreSQL, which comes with JSON
        support (since version 9.4), and would allow us to normalize the fetched data to some extent
    </li>
    <li>
        Generate more complex SQL, creating an own output format that is "hydrator-friendly" (re-inventing
        the wheel here seems like a bad idea)
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Research material</h2>

    <strong>
        <abbr title="too long, didn't read">TL;DR</abbr>: 
        Make your classes always <code>final</code>, if they implement an interface, 
        and no other public methods are defined
    </strong>
</p>

<p>
    In the last month, I had a few discussions about the usage of the <code>final</code> marker on PHP classes.
</p>

<p>
    The pattern is recurrent:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>I ask for a newly introduced class to be declared as <code>final</code></li>
    <li>the author of the code is reluctant to this proposal, stating that <code>final</code> limits flexibility</li>
    <li>I have to explain that flexibility comes from good abstractions, and not from inheritance</li>
</ol>

<p>
    It is therefore clear that coders need a better explanation of <strong>when</strong> to use <code>final</code>, 
    and when to avoid it.
</p>

<p>
    There are 
    <a href="http://verraes.net/2014/05/final-classes-in-php/" target="_blank">many</a> 
    <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/article/2073649/core-java/why-extends-is-evil.html" target="_blank">other</a>
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/137868/using-final-modifier-whenever-applicable-in-java" target="_blank">articles</a>
    about the subject, but this is mainly thought as a "quick reference" for those
    that will ask me the same questions in future.
</p>

<h3>When to use "final":</h3>

<p>
    <code>final</code> should be used <strong>whenever possible</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Why do I have to use <code>final</code>?</h3>

<p>
    There are numerous reasons to mark a class as <code>final</code>: I will list and describe those that are
    most relevant in my opinion.
</p>

<h4>1. Preventing massive inheritance chain of doom</h4>

<p><img 
    src="http://dilbert.com/dyn/str_strip/000000000/00000000/0000000/100000/00000/4000/000/104040/104040.strip.gif" 
    alt="Doomed"
/></p>

<p>
    Developers have the bad habit of fixing problems by providing specific subclasses of an existing (not adequate)
    solution. You probably saw it yourself with examples like following:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class Db { /* ... */ }
class Core extends Db { /* ... */ }
class User extends Core { /* ... */ }
class Admin extends User { /* ... */ }
class Bot extends Admin { /* ... */ }
class BotThatDoesSpecialThings extends Bot { /* ... */ }
class PatchedBot extends BotThatDoesSpecialThings { /* ... */ }
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is, without any doubts, how you should <strong>NOT</strong> design your code. 
</p>

<p>
    The approach described above is usually adopted by developers who confuse 
    <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AlanKaysDefinitionOfObjectOriented" target="_blank">
        <abbr title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr>
    </a> with "<cite>a way of solving problems via inheritance</cite>"
    ("inheritance-oriented-programming", maybe?).
</p>

<h4>2. Encouraging composition</h4>

<p>
    In general, preventing inheritance in a forceful way (by default) has the nice advantage of making developers 
    think more about composition.
</p>

<p>
    There will be less stuffing functionality in existing code via inheritance, which, in my
    opinion, is a symptom of haste combined with 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep" target="_blank">feature creep</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Take the following naive example:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class RegistrationService implements RegistrationServiceInterface
{
    public function registerUser(/* ... */) { /* ... */ }
}

class EmailingRegistrationService extends RegistrationService
{
    public function registerUser(/* ... */) 
    {
        $user = parent::registerUser(/* ... */);

        $this-&gt;sendTheRegistrationMail($user);

        return $user;
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    By making the <code>RegistrationService</code> <code>final</code>, the idea behind 
    <code>EmailingRegistrationService</code> being a child-class of it is denied upfront, and silly mistakes such 
    as the previously shown one are easily avoided:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

final class EmailingRegistrationService implements RegistrationServiceInterface
{
    public function __construct(RegistrationServiceInterface $mainRegistrationService) 
    {
        $this-&gt;mainRegistrationService = $mainRegistrationService;
    }

    public function registerUser(/* ... */) 
    {
        $user = $this-&gt;mainRegistrationService-&gt;registerUser(/* ... */);

        $this-&gt;sendTheRegistrationMail($user);

        return $user;
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<h4>3. Force the developer to think about user public API</h4>

<p>
    Developers tend to use inheritance to add accessors and additional API to existing classes:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class RegistrationService implements RegistrationServiceInterface
{
    protected $db;

    public function __construct(DbConnectionInterface $db) 
    {
        $this-&gt;db = $db;
    }

    public function registerUser(/* ... */) 
    {
        // ...

        $this-&gt;db-&gt;insert($userData);

        // ...
    }
}

class SwitchableDbRegistrationService extends RegistrationService
{
    public function setDb(DbConnectionInterface $db)
    {
        $this-&gt;db = $db;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This example shows a set of flaws in the thought-process that led to the 
    <code>SwitchableDbRegistrationService</code>:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The <code>setDb</code> method is used to change the <code>DbConnectionInterface</code> at runtime, which seems
        to hide a different problem being solved: maybe we need a <code>MasterSlaveConnection</code> instead?
    </li>
    <li>
        The <code>setDb</code> method is not covered by the <code>RegistrationServiceInterface</code>, therefore
        we can only use it when we strictly couple our code with the <code>SwitchableDbRegistrationService</code>,
        which defeats the purpose of the contract itself in some contexts.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <code>setDb</code> method changes dependencies at runtime, and that may not be supported
        by the <code>RegistrationService</code> logic, and may as well lead to bugs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Maybe the <code>setDb</code> method was introduced because of a bug in the original implementation: why
        was the fix provided this way? Is it an actual fix or does it only fix a symptom?
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    There are more issues with the <code>setDb</code> example, but these are the most relevant ones for our purpose
    of explaining why <code>final</code> would have prevented this sort of situation upfront.
</p>

<h4>4. Force the developer to shrink an object's public API</h4>

<p>
    Since classes with a lot of public methods are very likely to break the 
    <abbr title="Single Responsibility Principle">SRP</abbr>, it is often true that a developer will want to override
    specific API of those classes.
</p>

<p>
    Starting to make every new implementation <code>final</code> forces the developer to think about new APIs upfront,
    and about keeping them as small as possible.
</p>

<h4>5. A <code>final</code> class can always be made extensible</h4>

<p>
    Coding a new class as <code>final</code> also means that you can make it extensible at any point in time (if really
    required).
</p>

<p>
    No drawbacks, but you will have to explain your reasoning for such change to yourself and other members 
    in your team, and that discussion may lead to better solutions before anything gets merged.
</p>

<h4>6. <code>extends</code> breaks encapsulation</h4>

<p>
    Unless the author of a class specifically designed it for extension, then you should consider it <code>final</code>
    even if it isn't.
</p>

<p>
    Extending a class breaks encapsulation, and can lead to unforeseen consequences and/or 
    <abbr title="Backwards Compatibility">BC</abbr> breaks: think twice before using the <code>extends</code> keyword,
    or better, make your classes <code>final</code> and avoid others from having to think about it.
</p>

<h4>7. You don't need that flexibility</h4>

<p>
    One argument that I always have to counter is that <code>final</code> reduces flexibility of use of a codebase.
</p>

<p>
    My counter-argument is very simple: you don't need that flexibility.
</p>

<p>
    Why do you need it in first place?
    Why can't you write your own customized implementation of a contract?
    Why can't you use composition?
    Did you carefully think about the problem?
</p>

<p>
    If you still need to remove the <code>final</code> keyword from an implementation, then there may be some other 
    sort of code-smell involved.
</p>

<h4>8. You are free to change the code</h4>

<p>
    Once you made a class <code>final</code>, you can change it as much as it pleases you.
</p>

<p>
    Since encapsulation is guaranteed to be maintained, the only thing that you have to care about is that the public API.
</p>

<p>
    Now you are free to rewrite everything, as many times as you want.
</p>

<h3>When to <strong>avoid</strong> <code>final</code>:</h3>

<p>
    Final classes <strong>only work effectively under following assumptions</strong>:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>There is an abstraction (interface) that the final class implements</li>
    <li>All of the public API of the final class is part of that interface</li>
</ol>

<p>
    If one of these two pre-conditions is missing, then you will likely reach a point in time when you will make the
    class extensible, as your code is not truly relying on abstractions.
</p>

<p>
    An exception can be made if a particular class represents a set of constraints or concepts that are totally 
    immutable, inflexible and global to an entire system.
    A good example is a mathematical operation: <code>$calculator->sum($a, $b)</code> will unlikely change over time.
    In these cases, it is safe to assume that we can use the <code>final</code> keyword without an abstraction to 
    rely on first.
</p>

<p>
    Another case where you do not want to use the <code>final</code> keyword is on existing classes: that can only
    be done if you follow <a href="http://semver.org/" target="_blank">semver</a> and you bump the major version
    for the affected codebase.
</p>

<h3>Try it out!</h3>

<p>
    After having read this article, consider going back to your code, and if you never did so,
    adding your first <code>final</code> marker to a class that you are planning to implement.
</p>

<p>
    You will see the rest just getting in place as expected.

            <link href="/blog/roave-security-advisories-protect-against-composer-packages-with-security-issues"/>
            <updated>2014-12-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/roave-security-advisories-protect-against-composer-packages-with-security-issues</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><hr/></p>

<p>
    Since it's almost christmas, it's also time to release a new project!
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="https://twitter.com/RoaveTeam" target="_blank">Roave Team</a> is pleased to announce the release of
    <a href="https://github.com/Roave/SecurityAdvisories" target="_blank">roave/security-advisories</a>, a package
    that keeps known security issues out of your project.
</p>

<p>
    Before telling you more, go grab it:
</p>

<pre><code class="sh">mkdir roave-security-advisories-test
cd roave-security-advisories-test
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php --

./composer.phar require roave/security-advisories:dev-master
</code></pre>

<p>
    Hold on: I will tell you what to do with it in a few.
</p>

<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/Roave/SecurityAdvisories" target="_blank">roave/security-advisories</a> is a composer
    package that prevents installation of packages with known security issues.
</p>

<h3>Yet another one?</h3>

<p>
    Last year, <a href="https://twitter.com/fabpot" target="_blank">Fabien Potencier</a> 
    <a href="http://fabien.potencier.org/article/67/don-t-use-php-libraries-with-known-security-issues" target="_blank">announced</a>
    the <a href="https://security.sensiolabs.org/" target="_blank">security.sensiolabs.org</a> project.
    This october, he 
    <a href="http://fabien.potencier.org/article/74/the-php-security-advisories-database" target="_blank">announced again</a> 
    that the project was being moved 
    <a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories" target="_blank">to the open-source FriendsOfPHP organization</a>.
</p>

<p>
    While I like the idea of integrating security checks with my 
    <abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr>, I don't like the fact that it is possible to install
    and run harmful software before those checks.
    <br/>
    I also don't want to install and run an additional CLI tool for something that composer can provide directly.
</p>

<p>
    That's why I had the idea of just compiling a list of <code>conflict</code> versions from 
    <a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories" target="_blank"></a> into a composer
    <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#type" target="_blank">metapackage</a>:
</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QkjD3D5FgmE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>
    This has various advantages:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        No files or actual dependencies are added to the project, since a "metapackage" does not provide 
        a vendor directory by itself
    </li>
    <li>
        Packages with security issues are filtered out during dependency resolution: they will not even be downloaded
    </li>
    <li>
        No more CLI tool to run separately, no more <abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr> setup steps
    </li>
    <li>
        No need to upgrade the tool separately
    </li>
    <li>
        No coupling or version constraints with any dependencies used by similar CLI-based alternatives
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Try it out!</h3>

<p>
    Now that you installed <code>roave/security-advisories</code>, you can try out how it works:
</p>

<pre><code class="sh">cd roave-security-advisories-test

./composer.phar require symfony/symfony:2.5.2 # this will fail
./composer.phar require zendframework/zendframework:2.3.1 # this will fail
./composer.phar require symfony/symfony:~2.6 # works!
./composer.phar require zendframework/zendframework:~2.3 # works!
</code></pre>

<p>
    Simple enough!
</p>

<p>
    Please just note that this only works when adding new dependencies or when running <code>composer update</code>:
    security issues in your <code>composer.lock</code> cannot be checked with this technique.
</p>

<h3>Why is there no tagged version?</h3>

<p>
    Because of how composer dependency resolution works, it is not possible to have more than one version of 
    <code>roave/security-advisories</code> other than <code>dev-master</code>. More about this is on the 
    <a href="https://github.com/Roave/SecurityAdvisories" target="_blank">project page</a>

            <updated>2014-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
    Last year, I
    <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/4145" target="_blank">worked on a feature</a>
    for ZF2 called
    <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.3/en/modules/zend.service-manager.delegator-factories.html" target="_blank">
        "Delegator Service Factories"
    </a>, which was included in Zend Framework 2.2.0.
</p>

<p>
    It seems to me that many ZF2 developers either don't fully understand the feature,
    or do not know it.
</p>

<p>
    This article analyzes the feature in depth and tries to explain what these do, and why you may need them.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>
    While working with <code>Zend\ServiceManager</code>, we often find ourselves in the need
    of overriding services provided by third-party modules that we use.
</p>

<p>
    Let's make a practical example and assume that we are using a <code>DbLoggingModule</code>.
    provided by a friendly open-source developer.
</p>

<p>
    The developer of <code>DbLoggingModule</code> provided us with an awesome service
    called <code>"DbLoggingModule\Logger"</code>, which is created by a service factory
    <code>DbLoggingModule\Factory\LoggerFactory</code>:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class LoggerFactory implements FactoryInterface
{
    public function createService(ServiceLocatorInterface $sm)
    {
        $config = $sm-&gt;get('Config');
        $db     = new DB($config['db_logging']['dsn']);

        // more db configuration here

        $logger = new Logger($db);

        $logger-&gt;addFilter(new ErrorFilter());

        // more logger configuration here

        return $logger;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is awesome and clean, but then we want to be able to log all errors by
    removing the pre-configured filters, or we want to add a formatter to our logger to add
    contextual information to the logged messages.
</p>

<p>
    This becomes tricky, since we now have to define our own factory for that logger:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class MyLoggerFactory implements FactoryInterface
{
    public function createService(ServiceLocatorInterface $sl)
    {
        $config = $sl-&gt;get('Config');
        $db     = new DB($config['db_logging']['dsn']);

        // more db configuration here

        $logger = new Logger($db);

        // removing this: we don't filters
        // $logger-&gt;addFilter(new ErrorFilter());

        // this will add some context from the HTTP globals
        // ("eeew", but useful for our logged messages)
        $logger-&gt;addFormatter(new HttpRequestContextFormatter());

        // more logger configuration here

        return $logger;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is fine, but our <code>MyLoggerFactory</code> <strong>duplicates a lot of code</strong> from
    <code>LoggerFactory</code>, and we now have to also strictly monitor any updates
    by the original developer of <code>DbLoggingModule</code>.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-danger">
    Code duplication is a huge problem, especially when we're localizing
    code from external dependencies.
</p>

<p>
    We can mitigate this issue by using an initializer instead:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class MyLoggerInitializer implements InitializerInterface
{
    public function initialize($instance, ServiceLocatorInterface $sl)
    {
        if ($instance instanceof Logger) {
            $logger-&gt;clearFilters();
            $logger-&gt;addFormatter(new HttpRequestContextFormatter());
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is a much cleaner approach, but there are major disadvantages as well:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        This initializer is being called <strong>once per each instantiated service</strong>,
        and that can lead to hundreds (seriously!) of useless method calls per request,
        and that for a single object that we wanted to change.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>All</strong> of our <code>Logger</code> instances are going to be affected
        by the change, and that is a big problem if we have more than one logger in the
        application.
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="alert alert-danger">
    That's pretty much <strong>technical debt</strong> that we are building up.
    We are being lazy, and we will pay for that if we go down this route.
</p>

<p>
    The solution for this particular problem is using "delegator factories".
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>What are delegator factories?</h2>

<p class="alert alert-success">
    A delegator factory is pretty much a wrapper around a real factory: it allows us
    to either replace the real service with a "delegate", or interact with an object
    produced by a factory before it is returned by the <code>Zend\ServiceManager</code>.
</p>

<p>
    In pseudo-code, a delegator-factory is doing following:
</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">service = delegatorFactory(factory());
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is the interface for a delegator factory:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace Zend\ServiceManager;

interface DelegatorFactoryInterface
{
    public function createDelegatorWithName(
        ServiceLocatorInterface $serviceLocator,
        $name,
        $requestedName,
        $callback
    );
}
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2>Delegator Factories applied to the Logger problem</h2>

<p>
    This is how we would use it to modify our <code>"DbLoggingModule\Logger"</code> service:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class LoggerDelegatorFactory implements DelegatorFactoryInterface
{
    public function createDelegatorWithName(
        ServiceLocatorInterface $serviceLocator,
        $name,
        $requestedName,
        $callback
    ) {
        $logger = $callback();

        $logger-&gt;clearFilters();
        $logger-&gt;addFormatter(new HttpRequestContextFormatter());

        return $logger;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> We are not using the first 3 parameters,
    which may be useful in different contexts (for example, when configuration is needed).
</p>

<p>
    We then add it to our service manager configuration to instruct the
    <code>Zend\ServiceManager</code> that we want our delegator factory to be used
    whenever the service <code>"DbLoggingModule\Logger"</code> is requested:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
return [
    'delegators' =&gt; [
        'DbLoggingModule\Logger' =&gt; [
            'LoggerDelegatorFactory',
            // can add more of these delegator factories here
        ],
    ],
];
</code></pre>

<p>
    This will make the <code>Zend\ServiceManager</code> call the the
    <code>LoggerDelegatorFactory#createDelegatorWithName()</code> method
    whenever the service <code>"DbLoggingModule\Logger"</code> is instantiated,
    regardless if it is built via invokable, factory, peering service manager or
    abstract factory.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">Hint:</span> You can define more of these delegator
    service factories for a single service, which allow you to override service
    instantiation logic in different modules and multiple
    times, leading to a very fine-grained configuration flexibility.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">Hint:</span> Assuming that you want to completely replace the
    <code>"DbLoggingModule\Logger"</code> with your own custom implementation depending on
    context, you could also completely avoid using the provided <code>$callback</code>.
    This way, the original service won't even be instantiated.
</p>

<h2>On naming</h2>

<p>
    The name <q>delegator factory</q> is actually something I'm not happy with, since
    they are actually just wrappers around an existing factory.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-error">
    <span class="label label-warning">Warning:</span> Since I'm the first guy
    <a href="https://twitter.com/Ocramius/status/441673095662018561" target="_blank">to shout out at Laravel Facades</a>,
    I want to make it clear that the naming "Delegator Factory" is wrong, that
    it was my mistake, and I will likely fix it for ZendFramework 3.x.
</p>

<p>
    I initially designed these factories to solve a different problem, which is
    <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.3/en/modules/zend.service-manager.lazy-services.html" target="_blank">Lazy Services</a>.
</p>

<p>
    In the context of lazy services and decorators, the instance returned by these factories
    is indeed a
    "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern" target="_blank">delegate</a>",
    therefore I came up with the name "delegator factory".
</p>

<p>
    Only later on I realized that these factories are actually much more powerful than
    what I originally designed them for, therefore the "delegator factory" name became inadequate.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>
    Delegator factories are vital to any ZF2 hacker. Any developer working with <code>Zend\ServiceManager</code>
    should also be familiar with this functionality and its usage.
</p>

<p>
    Delegator factories are not a new concept. For instance, Pimple introduced this concept
    a while ago and (in a limited form): it is called
    "<a href="https://github.com/fabpot/Pimple#modifying-services-after-creation" target="_blank">extending a service</a>".
</p>

<p>
    The entire functionality was introduced by accident while I was working on an implementation of
    <a href="http://ocramius.github.io/blog/zf2-and-symfony-service-proxies-with-doctrine-proxies/" target="_blank">Lazy Services</a>,
    and they surely need a rename. This will not happen in Zend Framework 2.x.
</p>

<p>
    I hope this helps you with your day-to-day hacking around your ZF2 apps!

            <link href="/blog/lazy-property-automatic-property-initialization"/>
            <updated>2014-02-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/lazy-property-automatic-property-initialization</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
    Yesterday, I worked on yet another interesting little experiment, which is called
    <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/LazyProperty" target="_blank">
        LazyProperty
    </a>.
</p>

<h2>The problem with "lazy" properties</h2>

<p>
    The idea is very simple: avoid manually checking object properties to see if they were initialized.
</p>

<p>
    Let's make a simple example:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class UserService
{
    // ...
    protected $userRepository;

    public function register($user)
    {
        // ...
        $this-&gt;getUserRepository()-&gt;add($user);
    }

    // ...

    protected function getUserRepository()
    {
        // we're not using DI here because of performance implications
        // developers often use a service locator for RAD here
        return $this-&gt;userRepository
            ?: $this-&gt;userRepository = new MemoryUserRepository();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<p>
    This is a fairly simple approach, and it is perfectly fine to use it when we don't want to be forced
    to build the <code>MemoryUserRepository</code> instance for calls to API methods that don't use
    it.
</p>

<p>
    There is a problem though, which is that any direct access to <code>UserService#$userRepository</code>
    has to be avoided: all of the class' implementation as well as its subclasses have to rely on the
    protected getter in order to access the repository instance.
</p>

<p>
    For instance, the following code works only because of a lucky combination of events:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class UserService
{
    // ...
    protected $userValidator;

    public function register($user)
    {
        $this-&gt;getUserRepository()-&gt;add($user);
    }

    public function login($userId)
    {
        // mind this - this is a mistake!
        $this-&gt;userRepository-&gt;find($userId);
        // ...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$user = build_user_somehow();

$userService-&gt;register($user);
$userService-&gt;login($user-&gt;getId());
</code></pre>

<p>
    This code will run, but only because <code>UserService#register()</code> was called before
    <code>UserService#login()</code>.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Possible solutions</h2>

<p>
    The code in the examples exposes a silly bug, and it should be fixed by avoiding any property
    access to <code>UserService#$userRepository</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Moreover, implementors of subclasses will also experience the issue if they try accessing the
    un-initialized property. The fix for that is to just define
    <code>UserService#$userRepository</code> as <code>private</code> and being very defensive
    about its usage.
</p>

<p>
    These are all valid solutions, but we still don't get around using a protected getter in our
    class' scope, which I personally consider ugly.
</p>

<p>
    That's where I had this possibly crazy idea: making the property itself "lazy" and avoiding the
    getter call completely, making the getter an implementation detail.
</p>

<p>
    Let's see how this is done with the library:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class UserService
{
    use \LazyProperty\LazyPropertiesTrait;

    protected $userRepository;

    public function __construct()
    {
        // ...
        // mind this - we are marking "userRepository" as lazy
        $this-&gt;initLazyProperties(['userRepository']);
    }

    public function register($user)
    {
        // ...
        // now use the property directly
        $this-&gt;userRepository-&gt;add($user);
        // ...
    }

    public function login($userId)
    {
        $this-&gt;userRepository-&gt;find($userId);
        // ...
    }

    protected function getUserRepository()
    {
        return $this-&gt;userRepository
            ?: $this-&gt;userRepository = new MemoryUserRepository();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    By calling <code>LazyProperty\LazyPropertiesTrait#initLazyProperties()</code>, we've made sure
    that any access to the un-initialized <code>UserService#$userRepository</code> will actually
    trigger a call to <code>UserService#getUserRepository()</code>, and therefore initialize it.
</p>

<p>
    With that, we don't need to actually worry about calling the getter: both the getter call and
    property access will work the same way, which is pretty cool!
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Under the hood</h2>

<p>
    What is going on? I'm simply exploiting an feature of the PHP language on which I've already
    blogged at <a href="http://ocramius.github.io/blog/intercepting-public-property-access-in-php/" target="_blank">
        Property Accessors in PHP Userland
    </a>.
</p>

<p>
    As a reference, here is the annotated body of <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/LazyProperty/blob/fe60bd66455b6acf34fe0be25a83a625db6b2f88/src/LazyProperty/LazyPropertiesTrait.php#L37-L58" target="_blank">
        <code>LazyProperty\LazyPropertiesTrait#initLazyProperties()</code>
    </a>:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

private function initLazyProperties(array $lazyPropertyNames, $checkLazyGetters = true)
{
    foreach ($lazyPropertyNames as $lazyProperty) {

        // verify that a getter is available for the given lazy property
        if ($checkLazyGetters &amp;&amp; ! method_exists($this, 'get' . $lazyProperty)) {
            throw MissingLazyPropertyGetterException::fromGetter($this, 'get' . $lazyProperty, $lazyProperty);
        }

        // record the properties that were defined as "lazy"
        $this-&gt;lazyPropertyAccessors[$lazyProperty] = false;

        // if the property is defined, then ignore it (we don't want to sensibly alter object state)
        if (! isset($this-&gt;$lazyProperty)) {
            // unset the property, this allows us to use magic getters
            unset($this-&gt;$lazyProperty);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Quite simple! Nothing really incredible going on here. When is the property actually initialized?
</p>

<p>
    The other method defined by the trait is the <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/LazyProperty/blob/fe60bd66455b6acf34fe0be25a83a625db6b2f88/src/LazyProperty/LazyPropertiesTrait.php#L60-L84" target="_blank">
        Magic getter <code>LazyProperty\LazyPropertiesTrait#__get()</code>
    </a>:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

// returning a reference is required,
// otherwise (for example) array properties accessed for writes will fail
public function &amp; __get($name)
{
    // disallow access to non-existing properties
    if (! isset($this-&gt;lazyPropertyAccessors[$name])) {
        throw InvalidLazyProperty::nonExistingLazyProperty($this, $name);
    }

    // retrieve the object that is trying to access the lazy property
    $caller = debug_backtrace(DEBUG_BACKTRACE_PROVIDE_OBJECT)[1];

    // disallow access from invalid scope
    // basically reproduces property visibility in userland
    if (! isset($caller['object']) || $caller['object'] !== $this) {
        AccessScopeChecker::checkCallerScope($caller, $this, $name);
    }

    // set the property to `null` (disables notices)
    $this-&gt;$name = null;

    // initialize the property
    $this-&gt;$name = $this-&gt;{'get' . $name}();

    return $this-&gt;$name;
}
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>
    This "hack" is simple, clean, easily tested and doesn't cause any problems.
    It works on PHP 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and even on HHVM, which I wasn't expecting.
</p>

<p>
    Can you use it? Yes, why not? Do you need it? Usually not. Being defensive about usage of your
    APIs can actually avoid sloppy mistakes like the ones that I've described in the examples.
</p>

<p>
    Correctly annotating your properties with <code>/** @var Type|null */</code> also helps tools
    like <a href="https://github.com/scrutinizer-ci/php-analyzer" target="_blank">PHP Analyzer</a>
    in discovering such bugs via static analysis.
</p>

<p>
    Clean dependency injection and eventually proxying dependencies also produces better and easier
    testable results than explicit lazy-loading coded in your classes.
</p>

<p>
    The most interesting result in this experiment is that PHP yet again allows to implement
    language-level features in userland, which is awesome!
</p>

    you think it can be enhanced!

            <updated>2013-11-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/fluent-interfaces-are-evil</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
    Today, I had again a discussion on IRC on why
    <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/blob/2.4/lib/Doctrine/ORM/EntityManager.php" target="_blank">
        Doctrine's EntityManager
    </a> doesn't (and won't) implement a fluent interface. Here are my thoughts on why that's the case.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Recap: What is a Fluent interface?</h2>

<p>
    A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface" target="_blank">Fluent Interface</a>
    is an object oriented API that provides "more readable" code.
    <br/>
    In general, the template for a fluent interface can be like following:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

interface {InterfaceName}
{
    /** @return self */
    public function {MethodName}({Params});
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Obviously, PHP doesn't provide return type hints, which means that I limited myself to define a
    <code>/** @return self */</code>
    <a href="http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/for-users/tags/return.html" target="_blank">docblock</a>.
</p>

<p>
    A fluent interface allows you to chain method calls, which results in less typed characters
    when applying multiple operations on the same object:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$foo
    -&gt;doBar()
    -&gt;doBaz()
    -&gt;setTaz('taz')
    -&gt;otherCall()
    -&gt;allTheThings();
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2>When does a fluent interface make sense?</h2>

<p>
    Fluent interfaces make sense in some APIs, like the
    <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/blob/2.4/lib/Doctrine/ORM/EntityManager.php" target="_blank">
        QueryBuilder
    </a>, or in general builder objects, especially when it comes to putting together nodes into
    a hierarchical structure.
</p>

<p>
    Here's an example of good usage of a fluent interface:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$queryBuilder
    -&gt;select('u')
    -&gt;from('User u')
    -&gt;where('u.id = :identifier')
    -&gt;orderBy('u.name', 'ASC')
    -&gt;setParameter('identifier', 100);
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2>What's the problem with fluent interfaces?</h2>

<p>
    I've identified some issues while working with fluent interfaces. Here they are listed in
    descending order of relevance:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Fluent Interfaces break
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_%28object-oriented_programming%29" target="_blank">
            Encapsulation
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>Fluent Interfaces break Decorators (and sometimes Composition)</li>
    <li>Fluent Interfaces are harder to Mock</li>
    <li>Fluent Interfaces make diffs harder to read</li>
    <li>Fluent Interfaces are less readable (personal feeling)</li>
    <li>
        Fluent Interfaces cause <abbr title="Backwards Compatibility">BC</abbr> breaks during early development stages
    </li>
</ol>

<hr/>

<h2>Fluent Interfaces break Encapsulation</h2>

<p>
    The entire idea behind a fluent interface bases on an assumption:
</p>

<blockquote>
    In a Fluent Interface, the return value of a method will be the same instance on which the method was called.
</blockquote>

<p>
    First of all, "assuming" facts that are not safely constrained by the language is a mistake.
    <br/>
    Additionally, in OOP, you cannot rely on the identity of the returned value of an object, but just on its
    interface.
</p>

<p>
    What does that mean? Let's make an example with a <code>Counter</code> interface:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

interface Counter
{
    /** @return self */
    public function count();

    /** @return int */
    public function getCount();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a fluent implementation of the interface:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class FluentCounter implements Counter
{
    private $count = 0;

    public function count()
    {
        $this-&gt;count += 1;

        return $this;
    }

    public function getCount()
    {
        return $this-&gt;count;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Here's an Immutable implementation of the interface:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class ImmutableCounter implements Counter
{
    private $count;

    public function __construct($count = 0)
    {
        $this-&gt;count = (int) $count;
    }

    public function count()
    {
        return new ImmutableCounter($this-&gt;count + 1);
    }

    public function getCount()
    {
        return $this-&gt;count;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Here is how you <a href="http://3v4l.org/l5rr0" target="_blank">use a <code>FluentCounter</code></a>:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$counter = new FluentCounter();

echo $counter-&gt;count()-&gt;count()-&gt;count()-&gt;getCount(); // 3!
</code></pre>

<p>
    Here is how you <a href="http://3v4l.org/AP62m" target="_blank">use an <code>ImmutableCounter</code></a>:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$counter = new ImmutableCounter();

$counter = $counter-&gt;count()-&gt;count()-&gt;count();

echo $counter-&gt;getCount(); // 3!
</code></pre>

<p>
    We managed to implement an immutable counter even though the author of <code>Counter</code> maybe
    assumed that all implementations should be mutable.
</p>

<p>
    The same can be seen in the opposite direction: interface author may want to have all implementations
    immutable, but then people implement a mutable version of it.
</p>

<p>
    Turns out that the only correct way of
    <a href="http://3v4l.org/fILUc" target="_blank">using such an interface</a>
    is the "immutable" way, so:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$counter = $counter-&gt;count()-&gt;count()-&gt;count();

echo $counter-&gt;getCount(); // 3!
</code></pre>

<p>
    This ensures that <code>FluentCounter#getCount()</code> works as expected, but obviously defeats the
    purpose of the fluent interface.
</p>

<p>
    On top of that, there is nothing that the author of <code>Counter</code> can do to enforce either one or
    the other way of implementing the contract, and that's a limitation of the language itself (and it's
    most probably for good!).
</p>

<p>
    None of the implementors/implementations are wrong. What is wrong here is the interface by trying to
    force implementation details, therefore breaking encapsulation.
</p>

<p>Wrapping it up:</p>

<ul>
    <li>In OOP, a contract cannot guarantee the identity of a method return value</li>
    <li>Therefore, In OOP, fluent interfaces cannot be guaranteed by a contract</li>
    <li>Assumptions not backed by a contract are wrong</li>
    <li>Following wrong assumptions leads to wrong results</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<h2>Fluent Interfaces break Decorators (and Composition)</h2>

<p>
    As some of you may know, I'm putting a lot of effort in writing libraries that
    <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager/" target="_blank">generate decorators and proxies</a>.
    <br/>
    While working on those, I came to a very complex use case where I needed to build a generic wrapper around
    an object.
</p>

<p>
    I'm picking the <code>Counter</code> example again:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

interface Counter
{
    /** @return self */
    public function count();

    /** @return int */
    public function getCount();
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Assuming that the implementor of the wrapper doesn't know anything about the implementations of this
    interface, he goes on and builds a wrapper.
</p>

<p>
    In this example, the implementor simply writes a wrapper that echoes every time one of the methods is called:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class EchoingCounter implements Counter
{
    private $counter;

    public function __construct(Counter $counter)
    {
        $this-&gt;counter = $counter;
    }

    public function count()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . "\n";

        return $this-&gt;counter-&gt;count();
    }

    public function getCount()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . "\n";

        return $this-&gt;counter-&gt;getCount();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Let's <a href="http://3v4l.org/i5m5r" target="_blank">try it out with our fluent counter</a>:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$counter = new EchoingCounter(new FluentCounter());

$counter = $counter-&gt;count()-&gt;count()-&gt;count()-&gt;count();

echo $counter-&gt;getCount();
</code></pre>

<p>
    Noticed anything wrong? Yes, the string
    <strong><code>"EchoingCounter::count"</code> is echoed only once!</strong>
</p>

<p>
    That happens because we're just trusting the interface, so the <code>FluentCounter</code> instance
    gets "un-wrapped" when we call <code>EchoingCounter::count()</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Same happens when
    <a href="http://3v4l.org/bUMJ7" target="_blank">using the <code>ImmutableCounter</code></a>
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$counter = new EchoingCounter(new ImmutableCounter());

$counter = $counter-&gt;count()-&gt;count()-&gt;count()-&gt;count();

echo $counter-&gt;getCount();
</code></pre>

<p>Same results. Let's try to fix them:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class EchoingCounter implements Counter
{
    private $counter;

    public function __construct(Counter $counter)
    {
        $this-&gt;counter = $counter;
    }

    public function count()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . "\n";

        $this-&gt;counter-&gt;count();

        return $this;
    }

    public function getCount()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . "\n";

        return $this-&gt;counter-&gt;getCount();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And now let's <a href="http://3v4l.org/AilJu" target="_blank">retry</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$counter = new EchoingCounter(new FluentCounter());

$counter = $counter-&gt;count()-&gt;count()-&gt;count()-&gt;count();

echo $counter-&gt;getCount();
</code></pre>

<p>
    Works! We now see the different <code>EchoingCounter::count</code> being echoed.
    <br/>
    What about the immutable implementation?
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$counter = new EchoingCounter(new ImmutableCounter());

// we're using the "SAFE" solution here
$counter = $counter-&gt;count()-&gt;count()-&gt;count()-&gt;count();

echo $counter-&gt;getCount();
</code></pre>

<p>
    <a href="http://3v4l.org/FuX4X" target="_blank">Seems to work</a>, but if you look closely,
    the reported count is wrong. Now the wrapper is working, but not the real logic!
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, we cannot fix this with a generic solution.
    <br/>
    We don't know if the wrapped instance is supposed to return itself or a new instance.
    <br/>
    We <em>can</em> manually fix the wrapper with some assumptions though:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class EchoingCounter implements Counter
{
    private $counter;

    public function __construct(Counter $counter)
    {
        $this-&gt;counter = $counter;
    }

    public function count()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . "\n";

        $this-&gt;counter = $this-&gt;counter-&gt;count();

        return $this;
    }

    public function getCount()
    {
        echo __METHOD__ . "\n";

        return $this-&gt;counter-&gt;getCount();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    As you can see, we have to manually patch the <code>count()</code> method, but then again, this breaks
    the case when the API is neither Immutable nor Fluent.
    <br/>
    Additionally, our wrapper is now opinionated about the usage of the <code>count()</code> method, and it is
    not possible to build a generic wrapper anymore.
</p>

<p>
    I conclude this section by simply stating that fluent interfaces are problematic for wrappers, and require
    a lot of assumptions to be catched by a human decision, which has to be done per-method, based on
    assumptions.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Fluent Interfaces are harder to Mock</h2>

<p>
    Mock classes (at least in PHPUnit) are
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern" target="_blank">null objects</a> by default,
    which means that all the return values of methods have to be manually defined:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$counter = $this-&gt;getMock('Counter');

$counter
    -&gt;expects($this-&gt;any())
    -&gt;method('count')
    -&gt;will($this-&gt;returnSelf());
</code></pre>

<p>
    There are 2 major problems with this:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>All fluent methods need explicit mocking</li>
    <li>We are assuming that a fluent interface is implemented, whereas the implementation may be immutable (as shown before)</li>
</ol>

<p>
    That basically means that we have to code assumptions in our unit tests (bad, and hard to follow).
</p>

<p>
    Also, we have to make decisions on the implementation of a mocked object
</p>

<p>
    The correct way of mocking the <code>Counter</code> interface would be something like:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$counter = $this-&gt;getMock('Counter');

$counter
    -&gt;expects($this-&gt;any())
    -&gt;method('count')
    -&gt;will($this-&gt;returnValue($this-&gt;getMock('Counter')));
</code></pre>

<p>
    As you can see, we can break our code by making the mock behave differently, but still respecting the
    interface. Additionally, we need to mock every fluent method regardless of the parameters or even when
    we don't have expectations on the API.
</p>

<p>
    That is a lot of work, and a lot of <strong>wrong</strong> work to be done.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Fluent Interfaces make diffs harder to read</h2>

<p>
    The problem with diffs is minor, but it's something that really
    <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/that-really-rustled-my-jimmies" target="_blank">rustles my jimmies</a>,
    especially because people abuse fluent interfaces to write giant chained method calls like:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$foo
    -&gt;addBar('bar')
    -&gt;addBaz('baz')
    -&gt;addTab('tab')
    -&gt;addBar('bar')
    -&gt;addBaz('baz')
    -&gt;addTab('tab')
    -&gt;addBar('bar')
    -&gt;addBaz('baz')
    -&gt;addTab('tab')
    -&gt;addBar('bar')
    -&gt;addBaz('baz')
    -&gt;addTab('tab')
    -&gt;addBar('bar')
    -&gt;addBaz('baz')
    -&gt;addTab('tab')
    -&gt;addBar('bar')
    -&gt;addBaz('baz')
    -&gt;addTab('tab')
    -&gt;addBar('bar')
    -&gt;addBaz('baz')
    -&gt;addTab('tab')
    -&gt;addBar('bar')
    -&gt;addBaz('baz')
    -&gt;addTab('tab')
    -&gt;addBar('bar')
    -&gt;addBaz('baz')
    -&gt;addTab('tab');
</code></pre>

<p>
    Let's assume that a line is changed in the middle of the chain:
</p>

<pre><code class="sh">$ diff -p left.txt right.txt
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="diff">*** left.txt    Fri Nov  8 15:05:09 2013
--- right.txt   Fri Nov  8 15:05:22 2013
***************
*** 11,16 ****
--- 11,17 ----
    -&gt;addTab('tab')
    -&gt;addBar('bar')
    -&gt;addBaz('baz')
+     -&gt;addBaz('tab')
    -&gt;addTab('tab')
    -&gt;addBar('bar')
    -&gt;addBaz('baz')
</code></pre>

<p>
    Not really useful, huh? Where do we see the object this <code>addBaz()</code> is being called on?
</p>

<p>
    This may look like nitpicking, but it makes code reviews harder, and I personally do a lot of code reviews.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Fluent Interfaces are less readable</h2>

<p>
    This is a personal feeling, but when reading a fluent interface, I cannot recognize if what is going on
    is just a massive violation of the
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter" target="_blank">Law of Demeter</a>, or if we're
    dealing with the same object over and over again.
    <br/>
    I'm picking an obvious example to show where this may happen:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
return $queryBuilder
    -&gt;select('u')
    -&gt;from('User u')
    -&gt;where('u.id = :identifier')
    -&gt;orderBy('u.name', 'ASC')
    -&gt;setFirstResult(5)
    -&gt;setParameter('identifier', 100)
    -&gt;getQuery()
    -&gt;setMaxResults(10)
    -&gt;getResult();
</code></pre>

<p>
    This one is quite easy to follow: <code>getQuery()</code> and <code>getResult()</code> are returning
    different objects that have a different API.
    <br/>
    The problem occurs when a method does not look like a getter:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
return $someBuilder
    -&gt;addThing('thing')
    -&gt;addOtherThing('other thing')
    -&gt;compile()
    -&gt;write()
    -&gt;execute()
    -&gt;gimme();
</code></pre>

<p>
    Which of these method calls is part of a fluent interface? Which is instead
    returning a different object? You can't really tell that...
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Fluent Interfaces cause <abbr title="Backwards Compatibility">BC</abbr> breaks</h2>

<p>
    Declaring an <code>@return void</code> type allows you to change the method behavior later on.
</p>

<p>
    Eagerly declaring a <code>@return self</code> precludes that choice, and changing the signature of the
    method will inevitably result in a <abbr title="Backwards Compatibility">BC</abbr> break.
</p>

<p>
    Using <code>void</code> as a default return type allows for more flexible and rapid design while 
    we are prototyping around a piece of our codebase.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
    I know the article is titled <q>"Fluent Interfaces are Evil"</q>, but that doesn't mean it's an absolute.
</p>

<p>
    Fluent interfaces are useful and easy to read in <strong>some contexts</strong>.
    What I am showing here is a set of problems that raise when inheriting them or making every piece of your
    code fluent.
</p>

<p>
    I just want you to think carefully next time you want fluent interfaces in your libraries,
    especially about the downsides that I have just exposed.
</p>

<p>
    You must have a <strong>very good reason</strong> to implement a fluent interface, otherwise it's just
    a problem that you are possibly dragging into your codebase.

            <title type="html"><![CDATA[Fast PHP Object to Array conversion]]></title>
            <link href="/blog/fast-php-object-to-array-conversion"/>
            <updated>2013-08-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/fast-php-object-to-array-conversion</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
    A couple of months ago, I found a forgotten feature of PHP itself.
</p>

<p>
    Apparently, it is possible to cast objects to arrays like following:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class Foo
{
    public $bar = 'barValue';
}

$foo = new Foo();

$arrayFoo = (array) $foo;

var_dump($arrayFoo);
</code></pre>

<p>
    This <a href="http://3v4l.org/dj6Ei" target="_blank">will produce</a> something like:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">array(1) {
    ["bar"]=&gt; string(8) "barValue"
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Private and Protected properties</h2>

<p>
    If we start adding private and protected properties to our <code>Foo</code> class, things get
    very interesting:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class Foo
{
    public $bar = 'barValue';
    protected $baz = 'bazValue';
    private $tab = 'tabValue';
}

$foo = new Foo();

$arrayFoo = (array) $foo;

var_dump($arrayFoo);
</code></pre>

<p>
    The output <a href="http://3v4l.org/vK1t6" target="_blank">will be</a> like following in this case:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">array(3) {
    ["bar"]=&gt; string(8) "barValue"
    ["*baz"]=&gt; string(8) "bazValue"
    ["Footab"]=&gt; string(8) "tabValue"
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Weird, so <code>$baz</code> is copied to array key <code>'*baz'</code> and <code>$tab</code>
    is copied to <code>Footab</code>...
</p>

<p>Let's try accessing those keys:</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

var_dump($arrayFoo['*baz']);
var_dump($arrayFoo['Footab']);
</code></pre>

<p>
    Something even more strange happens here:
    <a href="http://3v4l.org/JimNP" target="_blank">we get two notices</a>.
</p>

<pre><code class="php">Notice: Undefined index: *baz in [...] on line [...]
NULL

Notice: Undefined index: Footab in [...] on line [...]
NULL
</code></pre>

<p>
    I actually spent some time trying to understand why this was happening, and even the debugger was failing
    me! Then I tried using
    <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.var-export.php" target="_blank"><code>var_export</code></a>:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

var_export($arrayFoo);
</code></pre>

<p>
    The <a href="http://3v4l.org/UQlb0" target="_blank">output</a> is quite interesting:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">array (
    'bar' =&gt; 'barValue',
    '' . "\0" . '*' . "\0" . 'baz' =&gt; 'bazValue',
    '' . "\0" . 'Foo' . "\0" . 'tab' =&gt; 'tabValue',
)
</code></pre>

<p>
    Null characters are used as delimiters between the visibility scope of a particular property and its name!
</p>

<p>
    That's some really strange results, and they give us some insight on how PHP actually keeps us from
    accessing private and protected properties.
</p>

<h2>Direct property read attempt</h2>

<p>
    What happens if we try to directly access the <code>$foo</code> properties with this new trick?
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

var_dump($foo-&gt;{"\0*\0baz"});
var_dump($foo-&gt;{"\0Foo\0tab"});
</code></pre>

<p>
    Looks like the engine was patched after PHP 5.1 to fix this (un-documented break),
    since <a href="http://3v4l.org/e5hWG" target="_blank">we get a fatal</a>:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">Fatal error: Cannot access property started with '\0' in [...] on line [...]
</code></pre>

<p>
    Too bad! That would have had interesting use cases. The change makes sense though, since we shouldn't
    modify internal state without explicitly using an API that cries out "I do things with your objects state!".
</p>

<h2>Some notes and suggestions</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        This way of accessing properties via array conversion is quite useful when it actually makes sense to
        access object internal state. Don't use it otherwise.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is safe to use since an eventual behaviour change has to be documented. I provided a
        <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/358" target="_blank">test for PHP-SRC in a pull request</a>
        to protect this kind of usage.
    </li>
    <li>
        You should probably not re-map the private properties to simple names such as
        <code>baz</code>, since multiple inheritance levels may cause collisions in key names.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may have already noticed that I work a lot with internal object states: that doesn't mean that you
        should too.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    I'm currently writing a small library called
    <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/GeneratedHydrator" target="_blank">GeneratedHydrator</a>
    to take advantage of this behaviour and the one that I described in my
    <a href="">previous blog post</a>. That should prevent you from doing this
    kind of dangerous things with PHP :-)

            <updated>2013-07-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/blog/accessing-private-php-class-members-without-reflection</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
    A couple of weeks ago I was working on a
    <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager/issues/62" target="_blank">very tricky issue</a> on
    <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager" target="_blank">ProxyManager</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The problem is simple: instantiating
    <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/class.reflectionclass.php" target="_blank">ReflectionClass</a> or
    <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/class.reflectionproperty.php" target="_blank">ReflectionProperty</a> is
    slow, and by slow, I mean <strong>really slow!</strong>
</p>

<p>
    The reason for this reasearch is that I'm trying to optimize a
    "<a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/2.2/en/modules/zend.stdlib.hydrator.html" target="_blank">hydrator</a>"
    to work with larger data-sets by still keeping a low initialization overhead.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>PHP 5.4 to the rescue!</h2>

<p>
    PHP 5.4 comes with a new API for Closures, which is
    <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/closure.bind.php" target="_blank"><code>Closure#bind()</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
    <code>Closure#bind()</code> basically allows you to get an instance of a closure with the scope of a given
    object or class. Neat! That's basically like adding APIs to existing objects!
</p>

<p>
    Let's break some OOP encapsulation to fit our needs.
</p>

<p>
    The techniques to access private members are already explained on the PHP manual, but I am going to make a
    simplified example anyway.
</p>

<p>
    Here's what you have to do to steal <code>Kitchen#yummy</code> from following object:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class Kitchen
{
    private $yummy = 'cake';
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    First of all, let's define a closure to read the property as if we had access to it:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$sweetsThief = function (Kitchen $kitchen) {
    return $kitchen-&gt;yummy;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Let's use it to steal some <code>yummy</code> stuff from the <code>Kitchen</code>:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$kitchen = new Kitchen();

var_dump($sweetsThief($kitchen));
</code></pre>

<p>
    Sadly, this <a href="http://3v4l.org/ET06l" target="_blank">will result</a> in <code>$sweetsThief</code>
    being caught with a fatal error that looks like following:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">Fatal error: Cannot access private property Kitchen::$yummy in [...] on line [...]
</code></pre>

<p>
    Let's use <code>Closure#bind()</code> to make our thief smarter:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$kitchen = new Kitchen();

// Closure::bind() actually creates a new instance of the closure
$sweetsThief = Closure::bind($sweetsThief, null, $kitchen);

var_dump($sweetsThief($kitchen));
</code></pre>

<p>
    <a href="http://3v4l.org/2E2mr" target="_blank">Success</a>! We can now get to the <code>cake</code>!
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Changing closure scope vs. Reflection: performance</h2>

<p>
    How does this technique compare with <code>ReflectionProperty#getValue()</code>? Is it actually faster?
</p>

<p>
    I've built a simple benchmark to profile the "setup" step for this trick over 100000 iterations:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 100000; $i += 1) {
    $sweetsThief = Closure::bind(function (Kitchen $kitchen) {
        return $kitchen-&gt;yummy;
    }, null, 'Kitchen');
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 100000; $i += 1) {
    $sweetsThief = new ReflectionProperty('Kitchen', 'yummy');
    $sweetsThief-&gt;setAccessible(true);
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    On a freshly compiled PHP 5.5 (Ubuntu 13.04 amd64 box), the fist script takes around
    <strong>0.325</strong> seconds to run, while the second one requires <strong>0.658</strong> seconds.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Reflection is much slower</strong> here.
</p>

<p>
    That's completely un-interesting though, since nobody will ever instantiate 100000 reflection properties,
    or at least I cannot find a good reason to do that.
</p>

<p>
    What seems to be more interesting is how <strong>accessing properties</strong> compares. I've profiled
    that too:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$kitchen = new Kitchen();

$sweetsThief = Closure::bind(function (Kitchen $kitchen) {
    return $kitchen-&gt;yummy;
}, null, 'Kitchen');

for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 100000; $i += 1) {
    $sweetsThief($kitchen);
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$kitchen = new Kitchen();

$sweetsThief = new ReflectionProperty('Kitchen', 'yummy');
$sweetsThief-&gt;setAccessible(true);

for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 100000; $i += 1) {
    $sweetsThief-&gt;getValue($kitchen);
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    The first script took <strong>~ 0.110</strong> seconds to run, while the second one needed
    <strong>~ 0.199</strong> seconds!
</p>

<p>
    We are actually <strong>much faster than reflection</strong>! Impressive!
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Accessing private class properties by reference</h2>

<p>
    There's actually one big advantage in using a Closure instead of ReflectionProperty, which is that you can
    now <a href="http://3v4l.org/W12Hf" target="_blank">retrieve a private property by reference</a>!
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$sweetsThief = Closure::bind(function &amp; (Kitchen $kitchen) {
    return $kitchen-&gt;yummy;
}, null, $kitchen);


$cake = &amp; $sweetsThief($kitchen);
$cake = 'lie';

var_dump('the cake is a ' . $sweetsThief($kitchen));
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2>A generic property reader abstraction</h2>

<p>
    With all these new concepts we can write a very simplified accessor that allows us to read any property
    of any object:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$reader = function &amp; ($object, $property) {
    $value = &amp; Closure::bind(function &amp; () use ($property) {
        return $this-&gt;$property;
    }, $object, $object)-&gt;__invoke();

    return $value;
};

$kitchen = new Kitchen();
$cake    = &amp; $reader($kitchen, 'cake');
$cake    = 'sorry, I ate it!';

var_dump($kitchen);
</code></pre>

<p>
    Here's the <a href="http://3v4l.org/JE0eX" target="_blank">working example</a>.

<p>
    That's it: accessing any property, anywhere, and that even by reference! Success! We have broken the rules
    once again!
</p>

<p>
    I won't cover the "writing properties" part, nor handling inherited private properties,
    since that's just details of this basic trick that need more code and are un-interesting to us.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
    Yet another time, PHP shows its best and worst aspects all together. It's a horrible language with a
    horrible syntax, but it allows us to write amazing code and to run around a huge number of language
    limitations by just providing new and awesome features at every release!
</p>

<p>
    I won't use this technique myself, but it was interesting to dive into it, and it will become useful again
    if I need to get references to private/protected class members in my crazy proxy projects.
</p>

<p>
    I should hereby add a disclaimer: <strong>use with caution!</strong>
</p>

<h2>Errata</h2>

<p>
    In the first version of the article that was published 2013-07-10, I actually stated that Reflection
    was faster: that's not true and is the result of a mistake that I made while running the tests, since
    I was running a PHP version with loads of extensions that were affecting the results.
</p>

<p>
    I have created a virtual machine with a clean 5.5 PHP build to get accurate results, which demonstrate
    that <strong>Reflection is actually slower than closures in every case</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    I also wrote a very small set of benchmarks that you may find

    Some time ago many people were disappointed by the fact that
    <a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/propertygetsetsyntax-v1.2" target="_blank">PHP wasn't going to have
    property accessors</a>, which are a very cool feature and would have helped a lot in reducing
    boilerplate code in a lot of applications and frameworks.
</p>

<p>
    Last October I learned from
    <a href="https://twitter.com/lsmith" target="_blank">Lukas Smith</a>
    about a trick that he used to discover when a public property of an object was being accessed.
    <br/>
    He mainly used the trick that I'm going to show to handle lazy-loading within
    <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/phpcr-odm" target="_blank">PHPCR ODM</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The trick basically allows to implement property accessors in userland code by exploiting how PHP
    handles object properties internally.
</p>

<p>
    I never got back to writing a blogpost about it, but here it finally is!
</p>

<p>
    Here's a very simple example:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class Foo
{
    public $publicProperty = 'baz';
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    What we want is some way to know whenever somebody writes or reads property <code>$publicProperty</code>
    from our object.
</p>

<p>
    In order to do so, we can use a simple wrapper for our <code>Foo</code> object. Because we want to
    respect the <a title="Liskov Substitution Principle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle" target="_blank">LSP</a>,
    we have this wrapper extending <code>Foo</code>:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class FooWrapper extends Foo
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        unset($this-&gt;publicProperty);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    That's it so far! Let's try it out:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$foo = new FooWrapper();

echo $foo-&gt;publicProperty;
</code></pre>

<p>
    Weirdly, this <a href="http://3v4l.org/gRtoj" target="_blank">will produce</a>
    something like following:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">Notice: Undefined property: FooWrapper::$publicProperty in [...]</pre>

<p>
    That basically means the property was not just set to <code>NULL</code>, but completely removed!
</p>

<p>
    Let's use this at our own advantage by tweaking <code>FooWrapper</code> a bit:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class FooWrapper extends Foo
{
    private $wrapped;

    public function __construct(Foo $wrapped)
    {
        $this-&gt;wrapped = $wrapped;

        unset($this-&gt;publicProperty);
    }

    public function __get($name)
    {
        echo 'Getting property ' . $name . PHP_EOL;

        return $this-&gt;wrapped-&gt;$name;
    }

    public function __set($name, $value)
    {
        echo 'Setting property ' . $name . ' to ' . $value . PHP_EOL;

        return $this-&gt;wrapped-&gt;$name = $value;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    And here again, let us try it out:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$foo = new FooWrapper(new Foo());

echo $foo-&gt;publicProperty;
echo PHP_EOL;
echo $foo-&gt;publicProperty = 'test';
</code></pre>

<p>
    This <a href="http://3v4l.org/mmMZU" target="_blank">will produce</a> following output:
</p>

<pre><code class="sh">Getting property publicProperty
baz
Setting property publicProperty to test
test
</code></pre>

<p>
    Cool, huh? And the same works with <code>__isset</code> and <code>__unset</code> too!
</p>

<p>
    This doesn't really replace property accessors, but it gives us a way of protecting access to public
    properties via composition, inheritance and a bit of hacking.
</p>

<p>
    There's not many use cases for this right now, since you have to write a lot of boilerplate code for
    it to work correctly.
</p>

<p>
    It is worth mentioning that this logic has been used to make
    <a href="http://doctrine-project.org/" target="_blank">Doctrine 2.4</a> even more awesome.
    I also wrote a component called
    <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager" target="_blank">ProxyManager</a>,
    which avoids you from writing all the boilerplate code over and over again, so check it out!
</p>

<p>
    Here's how the code from before rewritten using ProxyManager 0.4:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

use ProxyManager\Configuration;
use ProxyManager\Factory\AccessInterceptorValueHolderFactory as Factory;

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

class Foo
{
    public $publicProperty = 'baz';
}

$config  = new Configuration();
$factory = new Factory($config);

$foo = $factory-&gt;createProxy(
    new Foo(),
    array(
        '__get' =&gt; function ($proxy, $instance, $method, $params) {
            echo 'Getting property ' . $params['name'] . PHP_EOL;
        },
        '__set' =&gt; function ($proxy, $instance, $method, $params) {
            echo 'Setting property ' . $params['name'] . ' to ' . $params['value'] . PHP_EOL;
        }
    )
);

echo $foo-&gt;publicProperty;
echo PHP_EOL;
echo $foo-&gt;publicProperty = 'test';
</code></pre>
