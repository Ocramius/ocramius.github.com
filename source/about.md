<article class="vcard">
    <p>
        Hi, my name is <a class="ocramius fn url" href="http://ocramius.github.io/">
            <span class="given-name">Marco</span> <span class="family-name">Pivetta</span>
        </a>,
        and I'm a software consultant working for <a class="roave fn url org" href="http://roave.com/">Roave</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="adr">
        My current location is near <span class="locality">Frankfurt</span>, in
        <span class="country-name">Germany</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        On the web and with friends, I am also known as "<span class="nickname">Ocramius</span>",
        which has been my nickname since a long time ago.
    </p>

    <p>
        I work on various open-source PHP projects, and am typically paid to work with backend PHP
        application architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am part of the <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/" class="doctrine fn url org">Doctrine Project</a>
        core team: we build the well known
        <a href="https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2">Doctrine 2 Object Relational Mapper</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you dig in my <a href="https://github.com/Ocramius" rel="me" class="github fn url">Github account</a>,
        you will also find out that I am part of the
        <a href="https://github.com/zendframework/" class="zendframework fn url org">ZendFramework CR team</a>,
        helping maintaining one of the most used, stable and secure enterprise-grade available PHP libraries.
    </p>

    <p>
        You should probably also know that I do not have a sleep schedule, which means that I am usually
        awake whenever there is work to do.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can contact me through my email address,
        <a rel="me" class="email" href="mailto:ocramius@gmail.com">ocramius@gmail.com</a>, which is also my

        You can also say "hi" to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/Ocramius" rel="me" class="twitter url">Twitter</a>,
