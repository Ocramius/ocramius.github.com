<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Well, that is quite simple: I hate Wordpress.</p>
<p>
    I have been working as a PHP developer all my life and having
    <a href="http://marco-pivetta.com/" rel="me" target="_blank">my own Blog</a> based on Wordpress is just a
    shame.
    <br/>
    I really dislike Wordpress, as it is also the cause of being labeled as a "second class" software developer.
    PHP is not Wordpress, but some people keep associating them, and I stand in the middle. Today I'm just doing
    my part in getting away from a platform that should be forgotten.
</p>
<p>
    So I simply decided to move on and to move my blog Github pages. I tried to go through the setup of Github
    pages with <a href="http://octopress.org/" target="_blank">Octopress</a>, but it was quite a pain to get all
    these ruby wrappers for simple commands (that already exist in *nix world) to run. I didn't manage to get it
    to run locally.
</p>
<p>
    I just decided to fallback to a pure <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>
    based solution. After playing around with something that actually works and that isn't just a mess of ruby
    dependencies (or doesn't crash with a different ruby version).
</p>
<p>
    What I did is picking the setup already done by
    <a href="http://erjjones.github.com/" target="_blank">Eric Jones</a>, who already had a nice setup which he
    describes in
    <a href="http://erjjones.github.com/blog/How-I-built-my-blog-in-one-day/" target="_blank">this post</a>.
